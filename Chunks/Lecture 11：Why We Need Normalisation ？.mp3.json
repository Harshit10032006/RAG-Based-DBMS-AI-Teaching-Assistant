good bye"}], "text": " Hello, how are you all? This is Lakshya. We have come to our DBMS lecture number 11. And today we are going to discuss a very important topic, an interview specific topic, which is called Normalization. What is normalization? Normalization. What is normalization? Why is it important? This is a very important topic. Because whenever you make DB, what do you want? You want there to be no redundancy in it. And if there is redundancy, then what problems arise from it? We are going to read all this in this lecture. So first of all, before jumping to normalization, let's know a small thing that what is functional dependency? Functional dependency. It is close to mathematics, but let's understand it very carefully. Suppose you have a table. And you have a table. It has A, B, C, D attributes like this. Right? So what do you say? Functional dependency means that you write some mathematics function. You represent mathematically that A determines B. Or you can say A determines C. What does this mean? That the A attribute is used to determine B. That is, if I will be given the value of A, I will have the value of A, then I can determine what is the value of B. Do you understand? It seems like something of the primary. I know the primary, so I take out all the other data. It is something like this. Functional dependency means that the attribute you have depends on what? What does it mean? If I give you the value of A, I give you the value of A, suppose here it is 1, 2, 1, 5, like this. So if I give you the value of 1, then you will give me the corresponding value of 2. Okay? This is the value of B. This is functional dependency. This means that your A, the left attribute, you can call it an attribute or a set of attributes. Because what happens in the primary? If you have two attributes, then it can be of the primary. So A can be an attribute, a single attribute, or a set of attributes. Okay? Keep this in mind. So I was saying that the left, the value I give you, the value you get from the left, I call it determinant. Determinant means it can determine. It has the capability to determine. B, because B is being determined, I call it dependent. Dependent means that what will be the value of B depends on this. When I give you the value of A, I give you the value of 1, then you will be able to get the value of B, 2. Similarly, if here is 2, this is 4, 5, 6, then if I give you 2 values in the table, then you will be able to get the value of B, 4. Okay? So this is functional dependency. There is no need to take much load. It is simple. It is just a mathematical representation that which attribute is dependent on which. Whose value will I give, then what will you be able to get. Do you understand? It is something like this. Let's move ahead. Now let's take an example of this. Example, your employee table. Does everyone remember the employee table? We have been studying the employee table for a long time. In this, there is an employee ID, there is a name of the employee, there is a department. Suppose I have this. Right? So if my employee ID is primary key, then I say that there is some kind of functional dependency in it. Functional dependency is called FDB in short. So I say that employee ID arrow employee name means this is your determinant, this is your dependent. That is, if you give me the value of the employee ID, then I will get the value of a specific employee name corresponding to it. Okay? So it is something like this. So I can say that employee ID can determine employee name. Similarly, one more dependency is called here that employee ID department if you give me the value of the employee ID, then I will search the value of the department and get it out of the table. Okay? Very good. Let's move forward. Now let's go to the notes. Let's see the definition of one and only. What is functional dependency? It is a relationship between primary key attributes. That is, as we can understand, when I give the value of one, give the value of the left, give the value of the A, then you will be able to get it out. Now I hope you have understood, it must be coming to your mind. So, such things are called prime attributes. Right? Primary key does something like this. Okay? So I can say that it is a relation between primary key attributes, usually, that is, primary key can also be, it can also be of candidate. Because you can get a primary key from the candidate keys. So, you choose a primary key from the candidate keys. Right? So it can also be of candidate. It is a relationship between primary key, usually, of the relation to that of other attribute of the relation. Okay? That is, if I am taking out some other attribute from the primary key, then I call it a functional dependency. Okay? Very good. You have understood the determinant and dependent. Now let's go to what are its types. What are its types? Everything is going on in mathematics. Okay? Everything is going on in mathematics. First of all, it is your trivial. Trivial FD. Trivial Functional Dependency. What is trivial functional dependency? That is, such a dependency in which A arrow B, means B is dependent on A, A can determine B, you can say like this. In this, B is a subset of A. B is a subset of A. Okay? There is a little problem in understanding. Okay? So let's take an example of this. Suppose, in the employee table, I have something like this. Employee ID, name, this can determine employee ID. Okay? I can say, I can add both employee ID and name, suppose, in the table, I say it is a candidate, I add both, so this can determine employee ID. Right? Because employee ID will be removed from employee ID. So I can say that, B, which is dependent on the right hand, is dependent on the left hand. This is a subset of A. Determinate is a subset. If it is like this, then I call it trivial functional dependency. Trivial means, what is the meaning of trivial? Trivial means, very obvious. Obvious functional dependency. It is done like this, with simple mathematics. Or, I can say like this, suppose, there is one more example, A determines B, which is this example, I can say that, A can determine A. A is determining B, so A can determine A too. This means, if I give you the value of employee ID, then you can remove employee ID. Ok? Very good. So I can say like this, that B can determine B. I can say this too. Why? Because A is a subset here. A or B is a subset here. It is B. Ok? So this is called trivial functional dependency. It is trivial. It is normal. Isn't it? Very good. Now let's go to the second type, whose name is non-trivial. Non-trivial functional dependency. Let's read this. Now suppose, I have added one more column here, address. Ok. I have the additional address and now I have such dependencies here so that, if I make the value of employee ID and Name , then I can search for the So, this is deter, minute and dependent. Now, if I ask you a question, is B a subset of A? No, it is not. In case of functional dependency, I can say that this is non-trivial FD. If I formalize it, I can say that if A determines B, then B is not a subset of A. Or A intersection B. So, in this case, this is non-trivial FD. I can say something like this. So, what is your functional dependency? If I give you the value of an attribute, that attribute should be of a candidate. And if you find another attribute, then I call it a functional dependency. I can determine B by A. And if B is a subset of A, then I call it a trivial functional dependency. And if B is not a subset of A, then I can give you an example of this. If I say that employee ID determines employee department. If I say that this is also non-trivial. Why is it non-trivial? Because department is not a subset of ID. So, in this case, this will be a non-trivial functional dependency. Very good. Let's go to notes. In notes, we have written that A determines B has trivial functional dependency. If B is a subset of A. And if B is not a subset of A, then it is called non-trivial functional dependency. Ok. So, if I try to show it in Venn diagram. If I make a Venn diagram of this. If I make a Venn diagram. Then how will the Venn diagram of trivial FD be made? Trivial FD will be made that I have A. And there is B in it. So, this is A and this is B. Ok. And how will the Venn diagram of non-trivial functional dependency be made? We said that what is the intersection of A and B? Null. So, it means one like this. So, A and B in it. So, A and B intersection in it. So, A and B intersection is null. Ok. So, we have understood something like this. Ok. We are playing this game in attributes. So, very good. Let's move ahead. Now, there are some rules of functional dependency. Which we call Armstrong's axioms. Ok. What is the first rule? Reflexive rule. What is said in this? If A is a set of attributes. If A is a set of attributes. If B is a subset of A. So, A and B holds. What does it mean? What does it mean? Let's understand reflexive. What is reflexive? Some of them are like your trivial functional dependency. Ok. Suppose you have some set of attributes. X. In which A, B, C, D, E. Ok. There are five attributes like this. Now, I will make a set of it. I will make a subset of it. It is a subset. It is a subset of Y. I call it A, B, C. Ok. So, clearly it is seen that the subset of the X set is Y. Ok. Reflexive says that if Y is a subset of X. If Y is a subset of X. So, in this case, your X can determine Y. Ok. You must be feeling very obvious. That when Y is already a subset of X. So, I can remove Y from X. If I know the value of X, I can determine Y. Right. So, this is a simple reflexive rule. Ok. Let's move ahead. Second rule is my augmentation. What does augmentation rule say? If B can be determined from A. Ok. If B can be determined from A. Means, A determines B. I have given this. Then adding an attribute to the function dependency will not change anything. Ok. It will not change anything. Let's see from the example. Augmentation. Suppose if you have been given that, X determines Y. Ok. X determines Y. You have been given an attribute. Your relation is. Your relation is X, Y and Z. Ok. This is your relation. Now, I have been given this dependency. This dependency has been given. If I will augment any other attribute with it. I will augment it. I will say that, X, Z determines Y, Z. So, this too. Will be true. Augmentation says this. If I have been given one dependency. X can determine Y. Ok. These are three attributes of the table. And in the three table attributes, this has been given. X can determine Y. So, if any third attribute or fourth attribute or set of attributes. I will multiply both sides. I am doing something like this. Right. I will augment both sides. So, this too will be a valid functional dependency. That brother, X, Z can find Y, Z. Ok. Very good. Let's move ahead. The third type of my rule is transitivity. Transitivity. Everyone has read in mathematics. That brother, if A can determine B. If A set of attributes can determine B set of attributes. And if B set of attributes can determine C set of attributes. Then I say that A can determine C. Ok. Everyone has read transitivity. That brother, A can determine B. B can determine C. Then this is obvious. That brother, A can determine C too. That brother, A can determine B. B can determine C. That brother, A can determine C. Very good. We have understood this. This is the three or four types of augmentation transitivity reflexive. This is Armstrong axiom. This should be known. Let's move ahead. Now there is a question. There is a question. Suppose there is a relation. The relation is A, B, C, D, E. Right. I have five attributes. Right. Now I say that brother, tell me this. From this, I can get A, B, C, D, E. Right. Now, I say that brother, tell me this. From this, I can get A, B, C, D, E. Right. Now I say that brother, tell me this. From this, I can get A, B, C, D, E. Right. Now I say that brother, tell me this. Which is the illegal relation? Right. I will write some relations. Is it legal or illegal? Right. So suppose I have given FDs in the question. What is the functional dependency? That brother, A can determine B. Right. A can determine C. C, D can determine E. And B can determine D. And E can determine A. Right. Now tell me. Can you determine B, C, C, D? Or can you determine A, B, C, D? Or can you determine B, C, D, E? Or can you determine B, C, C, D, E? Or can you determine B, C, C, D, E? Or can you determine B, C, D, E? If I combine both C and D, can they determine C, D? We have already studied a bit about augmentation. So look carefully. BD is a valid functional dependency. So if I add augmentation from both sides, then it is valid. Now let's move ahead. Now E, C can determine A, C. Is this valid? Yes, it is valid because E can determine A, E can determine A. So I can augment C with augmentation. So this is also a valid relation. Now look carefully, can B, D determine C, D? This can happen. Now look carefully, there is some augmentation in it. If I remove D from here, can B determine C? Is this true? Can B determine C? I have not been given any such functional dependency. So in this case, this is an illegal FD. Okay? Very good. Let's move ahead. Now there is one more question. Suppose there is a relation given to the coronary organ. A, B, C, D, E. Okay? I have been given a similar relation. This is E. Okay? So in this, what is FD provided to me? That A can determine B, A can determine C, C, D can determine E, B can determine D, and E can determine A. Okay? Are you not getting any confusion? These are all your attributes. These are attributes. Very good. Now tell me. Does C, D determine A, C? Can C, D determine A, C? Can C, D determine A, C? Can C, D determine A, C? Can C, D determine A, C? Let's prove it. Can this be done? Now look carefully. We have written that C, D can determine E. This is back here. Okay? And E can determine A. This is also provided here. So can I say that C, D can determine A by applying transitivity? C, D can determine A. Okay? What did we apply? Transitivity. C, D can determine A. We have clearly said that. Okay? Let's move ahead. Now look carefully. This C is a subset of C, D. C is a subset of C, D. So what does the triple functional dependency and reflexive rule say? It says that C, D can determine C. Okay? This is the triple functional dependency. C, D can determine C. So I can say that C, D can determine A. And C, D can determine C. So this means that C, D can determine A, C. Okay? So I have proved that this functional dependency is also valid. I can say that this is also valid. Very good. So now you can see how I used this and said that C, D can determine C. Right? I can say that. We had read this in reflexive. We had read this in reflexive. That Y is a subset of X. If Y is a subset of X, then X and Y will hold. So look carefully in this. Where is Y? Here is Y. Y is a subset of this. So it is holding. That this right hand side, which is dependent, is a subset of its determinant. So it will hold. Very good. Let's move ahead. So we have tried to do some things by applying some axioms. Right? But now we understand that why is Y normalization? Why is normalization necessary? Because we have understood the reason behind the word dependency. We have understood that it is normalization. Right? Why is it normalization? I say that to avoid redundancy in database, not to store redundant value. If I have to avoid redundant value in the database, If I have to avoid redundancy, then I take help of normalization. Right? We all know that redundancy causes a lot of problems. Right? A lot of problems are introduced by redundancy or redundant database. If I have such a database, Which contains redundant information stored, Then I optimize it in this way. In this way, Using your optimization technique, Using normalization, Optimizing it, I make a good database, In which the redundant value is less or equal to or not. Right? So that's why this is my use of normalization. Right? But now let's understand this before that, What happens if we have redundant data? If I have redundant data, I have redundant data, Then what will be the problem? First tell me this. Right? So I say, What if we have redundant data? Okay? Why do we normalize? If we have to remove redundant data, So one of the reasons to remove redundant data is that, That redundant data introduces, It introduces, Three anomalies. Now what are anomalies? Anomalies are abnormalities. Okay? It introduces three abnormalities. And these three types of abnormalities, Which data redundancy introduces, Your first is insertion, Deletion and updation. Now let's understand this carefully, What are these three types of anomalies? Let's write it here. Insertion, Deletion, Deletion, And, Updation. Updation is also called modification. Modification. This will be the first, This will be the second, This will be the third. Now we will understand, What are these anomalies? Okay? We have to think carefully again, That if redundancy is included, In my database, Then these three types of anomalies are introduced by it. Okay? Let's understand what it is now. Okay? Now suppose, I have made a table of students. Okay? We are saying that, There is redundancy in our database. I have not applied normalization yet. So in this case, Suppose, I have made such a database, There is data of student, There is ID, Name, Age, Okay? There is branch code, There is branch name, There is branch history. Now you must be thinking, Why is branch information is here? Okay? But you are so intelligent, Since we are studying DBMS from the beginning, So something is there in our mind. I said from the beginning, There should not be redundant data. There should not be redundant data. There should not be repeated data. Okay? So you can figure out properly. You can figure out at the time of ER model itself, That I make a different table of students. I make a different table of branch. Okay? You can think like this. But suppose, You have not thought anything like this. You have made a database by picking it up. Okay? In the beginning, You have made such a database by picking it up. Okay? Someone has made it. You have been given. Now I say, You are feeling that there is redundant data. Okay? But now let's understand this thing, What is the problem with this? First of all, The insertion anomaly, Insertion abnormality, What does it say? It says, That when certain data or attribute, Cannot be inserted into the DB, Without the presence of other data. Okay? Didn't understand? Let's understand carefully. Now suppose, A new student comes. Okay? New student comes. New student comes. Now he has not chosen the branch. Now he has not chosen the branch. He has just enrolled. Okay? You have added a new student. You have added 7. Okay? Suppose the name of the student is G. His age is 21. And now he has not chosen the branch. Okay? Now he is doing the same thing. What do you call it? Counseling is going on. Branch has not been chosen yet. Now what will you say? Brother, I set them null null. I set null null. Now, What will you say? Brother, I set them null null. Now, What will you say? Brother, I set them null null. Now, What will you say? Now, What will you say? Now, Now, You will update it after that. When he finds the branch. Okay? So see. How much are you trying to work? Either you set null null. Or you will say that Brother, I will not be able to enter it now. Because Not selected his branch. Okay? So this is what is being said here. Brother, Certain data I am not able to add. Because I do not have any other data. I do not have branch data. So I am not able to add it. Okay? I am not able to add it. Or I will add it. So With null values and then I will update it later. So, it is a double-double work. But think carefully that the existence of the student and the existence of the branch is independent. The student is different, the branch is different. Why have we combined them? So, this is your insertion and omelette. I am not able to add data because I do not have other data. Now suppose I have said, we can take one more example of this. Our university has IT department. We will teach IT department, we can teach IT department. So, I have decided the branch code, it is 4. Now I will add IT department here. But I do not have students who will be involved in IT. So, in the student table, we have made a table with so much of khichdi, I will not be able to include IT in it. Because, because, I do not have students who are corresponding to IT. So, I am not able to include IT. Or if I include IT, then I will have to add NLL. So, this is the insertion and omelette that two independent existence things should have been there. But what you did is, you merged it. So, what I cannot do is, I cannot insert IT department without any student enrolled. So, you must be coming to the mind that the existence of both should be independent. So, this is your insertion and omelette. Let's move ahead. Let's understand what is deletion and omelette. Deletion and omelette says that suppose that I have a student of mechanical. Let's remove it. This is your mechanical student. It has passed out. It has passed out. So, now I have to delete it. Let's remove it from here. Now, look carefully. What problem was created by removing it? By removing it, my branch, mechanical engineering branch has been removed. Suppose, there was only one mechanical engineer student in the university. So, now that branch has been removed. I said that my university is not taught by mechanical engineers. So, suppose that I did something that due to deleting the student, an important information has been deleted. Can I say this? This is your deletion and omelette. It says that the deletion and omelette refers to the situation where the deletion of the data results in the unintended loss of other important data. What was the important data? That my university used to teach mechanical engineering. But, because there is no student there, so, how am I telling you? How is it seen in the DB? That there is nothing like mechanical engineering in this university. So, I deleted some important data due to this redundant information. If I had made it a separate table of the student and branch, then it would not have been like this. It would not have been like this at all. This redundancy does not come. This anomaly does not get created. Okay. Let's move ahead. The third is your updation anomaly. What does updation anomaly say? Now, suppose that your HOD has changed. Okay. HOD has changed. Which department? The HOD of CS department has changed. Who was the first HOD? HOD was X. Now, their HOD has changed. Suppose, Q. HOD has changed to Q. Now, you must be understanding what the problem is. Okay. Now, what will I have to do? Because all the students who are enrolled in CS department, by going to their DB, by going to that particular column, I will have to update all the information. Okay. Why will I write here by cutting this? Why will I write here by cutting this? Why will I write here by cutting this? Suppose, I am a student of CS department. So, I have to write here by cutting this. Why will I write here by cutting this? Why will I write here by cutting this? Why will I write here by cutting this? So, in this case, see, a small information has changed. And because of this, I have to change multiple places in the whole DB. Okay. One place change was required. And I have to change multiple places. So, I call this updation anomaly. Okay. What does updation anomaly say? Update anomaly is when an update of a single value requires multiple rows to be updated. Okay. Do you understand me? Due to the updation anomaly, too many places, data can be in inconsistency. Suppose, suppose that you have to do a lot of updation. Suppose, there are a lot of tables. Okay. There is a lot of updation anomaly problem in your DB. So, what happens in that case? You could not update all the rows. Some one or two rows were not updated properly. So, what will happen in that case? Data inconsistency will arise. There are a lot of chances like this. Okay. So, these are your three types of anomalies. To rectify these anomalies, what we do is we optimize the database. In the sense of optimizing, we remove the redundancy from it. And the method to remove it is that method is your normalization. Okay. So, very good. So, we understood why we do normalization. To remove data redundancy. What is the problem with data redundancy? Three types of anomalies arise. Second, inconsistency can arise. Okay. And fourth, one more thing can happen. The size of the DB will increase. Now, look carefully. I have to store multiple information. Right. Here, CS department. I could have made a table. Simply. I made a table of department. That CS department has HOD X. Okay. IT department has HOD Y. Okay. And your EC department has HOD Z. I could have made a table by saying this. Okay. So, all the departments. I mean, there are five departments. So, there are five entries in that table. But what I have to do here. I have to repeat the data. I have to repeat. I have to repeat. So, the size of the database is increasing. And when the size of the database increases. So, when you search in the database. If you run queries in the database. Then that will also slow down. The database has increased. Okay. So, these are some problems that arise. From which? From normalization. Okay. Now, suppose I have to solve this a little. Okay. I have to solve by applying normalization. Okay. We have not learned normalization. Still, it must be coming to your mind. Let's do something like this. That brother, let's make a table. Let's make a table. let's make a table, today, the idea is. Day resolver Today is Friday. But today there is a date problem. That if you receive gelda news mean okay. But today if you see, now if you cross, you go to your laptop. Today,\ufffd\ufffd\ud130 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c's cat i call you crazy. Today's cat is chic succeeded in TY Google out. Now, results are comfortable, treatment is also sowed. Suppose these people always get compensation from that tab. Now if the dinner's is poorly prepared. Then people are allowed to live in space in virtual classes. Once you said someone is capable of actual soldiers, all other rules will not be Room Example. Or a school\u3057\u304f is not there at all. Then how will you go with your education. Look like a woman. Like a human means like I say. Ver \ud0dc Go If I make two tables like this, it will be very easy to see and view the database. All the inconsistencies will be removed. I will simply write here 123 CSECE and ME is X, Y and Z. Now I have to add the IT department. I will add the IT department. I will also add IT department. I don't have to add the IT department because I want to enroll students in IT department. It is possible that I have introduced the IT department that year but no student has enrolled. I can do this in this case. In this case, neither insertion anomaly nor deletion anomaly nor updation anomaly came. This is how you apply the anomalization. You must be understanding what we are doing in the anomalization. What do we do in the normalization? You can say what we do in normalization. We do very simple things that we have done a minute ago. We decompose the table into multiple tables. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And how long do I decompose? How long will I decompose it? How long will I decompose it? Until SRP is achieved. What is SRP? Single Responsibility Principle. What does this say? See, one table which is one table in the DB. It should have only one work. Okay. What was happening here? student table was storing information of branch and student was storing information of student so we have to apply normalization and decompose table till one table doesn't contain a single idea till one table doesn't contain a single idea so that's SRP principle decompose table and make multiple tables and apply SRP in that I am telling every table a single idea ok we have understood this very well now we will see what is types of normalization what are the normal forms and how we keep on increasing from one normal form to another normal form and keep on optimizing DB further and till when we optimize? till SRP is achieved till single responsibility principle doesn't come till one table doesn't start honoring a single idea ok very well first of all we will read first normal form which I call 1NF what is 1NF? 1NF is let's go to notes every cell of a table of a relation every cell contains atomic value contains atomic value you must be thinking this is simple thing we have read it earlier also you told that value of one cell should be atomic if I am adding contact number then contact number should not be further divided ok you have read it very well but let's see the formula 1NF should be there if your table is 1NF then it should be there ok relation must not have multi-valued attributes ok let's see its example suppose you have employee table ok in that there is id name and phone number ok id, name, phone number now you have suppose first employee one id of that after that its name is 1NF after that its name is A and phone number is 88 ok second employee his id is A his name is B and after that his phone number is 1299 suppose this is the number so 1NF says that nothing like this should not exist phone number should not have multi-values atomic value should be there ok so if I convert it to 1NF this is not in 1NF so what I will do if I convert it to 1NF I will make something like this table I have repeated the data ok you can see that redundancy is here also ok redundancy is here you are very intelligent we have read if multi-valued attribute is in ER diagram and I have to decompose it in table then what I do correspond to multi-valued attribute correspond to new table so when we are converting from ER diagram to relation model at the same time your mind is trained like this that you apply the normality ok but if I go formally theoretically theoretically something like this will happen that something like this is there and I will convert it to this so you see here data repetition is happening this is repetition this is repetition but 1NF in the first normal form it says this only that it does not consider repetition much but it says that the values of the attribute should be atomic so we made atomic values converted it to 1NF converted to 1NF ok just simple you have to keep this in mind in the case of 1NF second 2NF now let's see what is 2NF if I see in 2NF if I see in 2NF then what conditions should I have first condition is that the relation should be in 1NF form means all the values cells will contain atomic values second is there should not be any partial dependency there should not be partial dependency means there should be full dependency not partial now your term is full and partial dependency what is it ok let's understand in a minute but first see what terms are being said in partial dependency that all non-primed attributes must be fully dependent on primary that all non-primed attributes must be fully dependent on primary key and non-primed attributes can not be dependent on the part of primary key this is thejerking of partial dependency that all non-primed attributes that are apart from the candidate key which is apart from primary key and all non-primed attributes must be fully dependent on primary key it could be composite of primary key if it is composite still if both of them gets merged fully give grip but\u9055 broadcast and what should not be the non-primed attributes must be affected by primary part even if it are primary Suppose you have a relation which has attributes a, b, c and d And I say that the set a, b is of primary So we understood that there are four attributes And both of them are being decided by primary So I call the primary key attributes a and b as prime attributes These are prime attributes And apart from this, c and d are non-prime Now suppose you have a functional dependency In my relation, a functional dependency says that b can determine That can determine Now this is a partial dependency Now look carefully a is also of primary So a should also determine c This should be a functional dependency And a should also determine d This should be a functional dependency But here we are saying that b alone can determine c b can determine c alone Is this correct? This is your condition of partial dependency So it is saying that the dependent is dependent Dependent can be determined by the part of determinant From the part of determinant b is a part of primary We were saying that primary is complete a is also of primary But I am saying that c can be determined by b as part of primary So this is a clear cut case That there is partial dependency here There is a partial dependency Now see what can be the problem of partial dependency Partial dependency can be a problem Suppose a is also there So suppose I said a is also of primary So a is also of primary What does this mean? That something like this can happen If this is null This is some value This can be null Both of these can not be null Both of these can not be null But something like this can happen 3, 4 can be Something like this can happen One thing can be null Now look carefully I have said in the relation That a and b are of primary That means the attributes of both of these These two attributes Can not be single single Can not be independent Can not be null But one can be null Now suppose b is null in this Now in this case when b is null And I am saying b determines c I have said this now This is partial dependency b can determine c So now will this hold? Can null ever determine any value? Can not So this is the problem with your partial dependency That I can never leave partial dependency in my relation Because I am saying primary key That everyone is a primary key Is not it? There is a set of primary key I am saying this But the dependent is There is an attribute That is being determined by part of primary key Now what is the problem of being determined by part of primary key That it is also being determined by null So this is a clear cut case That primary key All together Termine some other attribute Okay Half or half Or its partial All parts together You can not determine any other attribute So this is a simple case That brother This should happen In 2NF Okay So if this case Which was your relation In which there were four attributes And this was the primary key And this was the prime attribute And this was the non prime attribute If I convert it in the form of 2NF Then If I convert it in the form of 2NF If I convert it in the form of 2NF If I convert it in the form of 2NF Then What will happen I will make one relation Think carefully We are doing decomposition here In the normalization We do decomposition One I make R1 I call it ABD I make one relation ABD I make another relation BC Okay Now Look carefully I will make the primary key in this AB In this I will make the primary key AB In this I will make the primary key AB In this I will make the primary key BC Okay So Look carefully Here I can say AB Decodes D Here B Decodes C Decodes C So Like this I made 2NF Conversion I made it divide in table Okay Very good Let's see A real life example of 2NF Okay Suppose I have a table Table I call it Student Student Student Project table Let's make it Now see an example I have a table called student project table So you can understand that student and project will be stored together So now Is this table in 1NF? Yes it is Because all the values are atomic But Now see carefully Student ID, Project ID Student Name and Project Name In primary key I am saying that both are primary and project ID Means these two attributes will be prime attributes and non prime attributes student name and project name These will be non prime attributes Now see what is functional dependency It has functional dependency Now see carefully Student ID can determine student name Project ID can determine project name Do we see partial dependency here? Ok What should have happened That both primary key and project name determine some attribute But see here There is one attribute Which is student name This is being determined by part of primary key So this is called partial dependency Project name is also being determined by part of primary key This is called partial dependency Now what we have to do to solve this We have to break the table We have to break the table By decomposing it We have to break the table So that student can make a separate table So we have to write Student ID Student Name So we will write this Let me make this Primary key So we will make a project table Where project name is called And make it primary key Now see carefully This is functional dependency Now it is being honored In this case of table It was partial dependency But here student ID Student name can determine student name Project ID can determine project name This is also full dependency Because in this project ID is primary key And in this student ID is primary key So the student name is not Dependent on part of primary key It is fully dependent on primary key So we have to make such a structure In 2NF We do something like this We remove partial dependency completely Very good We have understood this Now one more thing we are going to notice See from here project ID I have kept it on top Why I have kept it on top So that I can put linkage In both tables Because both tables were linked So I don't need to put linkage So this will be foreign key This is primary key We have understood So this was 2NF Let's read further What is 3NF Ok If we read about 3NF It is simple that relation should be 2NF So you understand that we are moving forward We are slowly optimizing the database further And more Crunch environment Restrictions are being applied So what is 3NF First of all 2NF should be there After that we will think about 3NF Now we read about transitivity There should not be transitivity dependency There should not be transitivity It means non prime attribute should not find non prime attribute Ok Let's understand what I am saying Non prime attribute should not find non prime attribute Suppose there is a relation In it A, B, C There are three attributes Ok Now if primary key is A That is A is your primary key Ok Let's see the functional dependency Which is given A determines B And B determines C And B determines C And B determines C Ok Now clearly you can see Something like transitivity That A determines B and B determines C That means A can determine C When A can determine C Then why did I put B and C's determination Think something like this Let's move forward Now let's understand Is it in 2NF What do I need to be in 2NF I need partial dependency Ok Atomic value I will tell you in H But partial dependency should not be there So that all the attributes B and C Be fully dependent on primary key Primary key is fully dependent C is also fully dependent Ok So 2NF is this So I can say 2NF is this Now let's see Because of 3NF What is the problem How does the redundancy come See this example Ok So this relation I have made something like this Now see carefully Is A determines B First I made it This is my primary key First function dependency What is A determines B When I give unique value of A I will find B So A will find B Here A will find B Means A can find B Now one more thing That B is finding C See carefully this B is 1 Here B1 is written Here it is X Here B2 is written Here Y is written Here B2 is written Here Z is written Now see carefully What was the prime attribute A was the prime attribute Ok But B is able to find C So see carefully A non prime attribute This is a non prime attribute He is finding a prime attribute A non prime attribute is finding a prime attribute Ok So this is not good to listen Why did I make this primary key Why did I make this primary key So that he can find everyone But here non prime is individually He is finding things Now see carefully What is the problem because of this What is the problem because of this See carefully Repetitive data So this point was saying Non prime attribute cannot dependant We are reading wrong We have to see 3NF Non prime attribute should not find a non prime attribute It should not happen It is happening here Now how can I fix this further How can I fix further This B C FD This B C FD This is introducing your transitivity This is transitivity Dependency So what can I do for this For this I I will break down I will decompose In 3NF form How can I do that First relation I make R1 A B Second relation I make R2 B C R2 B C R2 B C Now If I make such a relation And I say this is your primary key Here B is your primary key So now see carefully See carefully how the tendency Will be removed How will R1 table look Now see carefully I decomposed relation in 2 tables Due to this how the tendency is removed Now see carefully I made this prime attribute I have to fill only 3 rows Because A was determinant So I needed more rows Now see carefully What kind of tendency It is removed This tendency is removed So this is your 3NF form Very good Next let's go to 4th form Which is B C N F I will say its full form Full form is Boye chord normal form This is a strong version of 3NF This is also called strong version of 3NF What happens in this Relation should be in 3NF This is the primary condition Apart from that If I have given A function dependency So A should be of super A should be of super What does it mean We must not derive prime attribute From any prime or non prime attribute Means again I do not have to derive prime attribute Do you understand Means I have to derive prime to non prime attribute I have to derive prime to non prime attribute Non prime to non prime Which was being derived In which case non prime to non prime Was being determined In 3NF case This also we removed Now suppose some such situation came to me In which prime is being determined again Means in right hand side Means A determines B Which is B is prime attribute This is also a problem This is a problem that This is already prime Why am I determining it by someone else Ok Let's understand this through example So let's understand B C N F through this example This example says that I have student ID Subject is professor Now look carefully One student enrolled in multiple courses This is also enrolled in Java This is also enrolled in C plus Second is that one subject For each subject A professor is assigned Now look carefully for Java This student's corresponding Pj Professor is assigned And here for Java only But for this student Pj2 is assigned Ok Now look carefully I can understand that if I will add student ID and subject Then I can determine That brother There are two professors who are studying Java Ok There is a professor who is studying Java Pj1 and Pj2 So how do I determine Which student is teaching which teacher Means how to apply relations between all of them So what will I have to do to apply relations I will say that brother student ID 102 And Java By combining these two Which teacher is teaching it Pj2 is teaching And I have to add student ID and subject To your primary Because by adding student ID and subject I can find all other attributes And columns Ok Now it will be coming in your mind That multiple professor can teach single subject But there is one more constraint That one professor can't teach one subject Ok So I can say that one professor Can teach Only One subject Why are we adding all these constraints To understand BCNF Now look carefully This is in 1NF It is also in 2NF Because there is no partial dependency What will be the dependency One dependency is That brother student ID, subject By combining this Can find the professor This is the first FD What is the second FD That brother professor ID Subject By using this I can find the subject Why can I do this Because I said that one professor Teachs only one subject One professor Can't teach only one subject So in this case I can say This is your functional dependency And this is the functional dependency Ok So what is your prime attribute What is your non prime attribute These are my prime attributes These are my non prime attributes Now look carefully This is your prime attribute Is finding the non prime This is ok But now look carefully A non prime attribute Professor is finding the prime attribute Meaning we are going to reverse Trying to find the prime attribute This is written here Non prime and prime attribute Meaning we can't find the prime From prime attribute And also from non prime Meaning on right hand side Dependent can't be prime B means this So the second way to say this If A and B have a dependency A determines B Then A should be super A should be super This is the second way to say this We have read super Go and revise once B is the prime attribute This is not the key This is not the key of the professor So this particular table Is not in BCNF Ok Now how can we convert this into BCNF How can we convert BCNF How can we convert BCNF What I will do In normalization we decompose the table First table is student Ok We put the student's id And professor's id I can write 101 professor id 1 101 professor id 2 Ok And so on Second I make a professor table In that I write Professor's id And professor's name Ok Professor name This is professor name Let's remove it Let's write professor Because we were using this Professor and subject We have to write only one subject Ok Professor id 1 2 I will write pj They write java And this is pc They write c++ And so on So I have determined two table Now look carefully Is my condition of BCNF Fulfilling Here I will say This is your prime attribute Here is your prime attribute I was saying that one professor can teach only one subject So pj can teach java Ok Here pj2 will also teach java But here pid will be different So here your particular is Prime attribute So one prime attribute Is finding non prime But it is not happening that Professor is finding pid So this is BCNF So I call this BCNF Ok So these are some normal forms Which we have read We start from starting We see 1NF Then 2NF Then 3NF Then BCNF Now look carefully What was in 2NF If there was dependency alpha 2 beta Then there should not be any partial dependency That beta is part of primary It should not be dependent on it Ok So if this is non prime attribute And this is also non prime attribute So non prime attribute Can't find non prime attribute We have read something like this in 3NF Ok In BCNF If there is some alpha 2 beta Dependency Whether it is prime or non prime But it can't find any prime There should never be any prime attribute Something like this was happening here Here subject is It was prime attribute Right subject is prime attribute So non prime can't find prime This was BCNF So ok So this is normalization Now let's see what is the advantage of normalization We understood the advantage What happens with normalization Data redundancy is removed Because of data redundancy anomalies are not there So your DB is well structured Data inconsistency is also not there And database is fast Database is optimized So this was the topic of normalization I hope you understood So let's end this lecture here See you in next lecture Till then good bye"}

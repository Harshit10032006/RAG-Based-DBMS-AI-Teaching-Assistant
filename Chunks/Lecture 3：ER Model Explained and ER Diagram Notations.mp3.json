    "text": " Hello, what's up everyone, this is Lakshya. So, we are back with our database management system DBMS lecture no.3. And today we are going to discuss about a data model, a very powerful data model, which I call ER model, Entity Relationship Model. But before discussing this, let's discuss what we had read in the last lecture. In the last lecture, we had read the most important topic, that is, the view of data. I call it as 3 schema architecture. In which we had read about 3 levels of abstraction. Physical level abstraction, logical level abstraction, then we read about view level abstraction, then we read about database instance, what is DB schema, what are data models, what is the work of data models, why am I using data models, what is DBA, what are the works of database administrator, what are the types of application architectures. So, your host architecture, which is the host architecture, how to access the database, we discussed about this. In which your JVDC was, OBDC was, we discussed this type of thing. It was a very long and very good lecture, last lecture too. Now we are going to discuss about ER model. This video is sponsored by Cryo.

Thank you. Now what is ER model? ER model is a data model. And what does data model do? Data model works on your conceptual layer. On logical layer. The layer on which DBA works. Basically, when it is defining your database or data. That I have to describe the data inside the database. That I have to describe the data inside the database. What is that data? What is that data? What is that data? What is the relation between the database? Whatever the data is in that database, there will be some relation between it. What is that relation? What is your consistency constraint? To show all these, to visualize all these, your data model is used. In which there is a high level data model. Which I call ER model. Entity relationship model. Let's see the full form. Entity relationship model. Now what is this? It is a high level model based on perception of real world that consists of collection of basic objects. What happens in your real world? In real world, there are basic objects. Like student, professor, vehicle, your customer. So, these are real world objects. These objects are similar to the objects that we define in object oriented technology. I call those objects as entities. And what are entities? Entities have their own attributes. Like student. What are the attributes of student? Student has its own attributes. Student ID, name, standard, course, in which batch it is, contact number, address. Similarly, after customer, you have your own attributes. Like customer ID, customer name, what is its address. Its date of birth, age, etc. These are all your attributes. So, I can say that we have two things. One is entity, which is a real world object. And entity has some attributes. And why do we have entity attributes? What are the needs of attributes? Basically, to describe any entity, I need attributes. To describe entity, this is my entity. I show entity in ER diagram like this. And its attributes. I show in ER diagram like this. I make more attributes like this. So, I have entity and some attributes. Now, what do attributes do? Attributes define data. Like we talked about that data model tells data's what part. Data is the data in the name of entity. Like we call student. So, I know that this data is student's data. So, I have defined what. ER model has defined what. Then I have to describe that entity. Or data. What are its attributes? I have to describe data. I keep it simple that this is student. For example, Ram's name is student. So, I say that you won't understand anything. You won't know anything about student. So, to describe data. Who describe it? Attributes describe it. That there is entity, there are attributes. They are describing data. A simple example of this is students. So, I have to describe student. If I draw entity. So, what are its attributes? We are talking about ER model terms. So, that you don't get confused. Because finally, you can be asked to make ER model only in the interview. What are its attributes? Student ID. I say name. Phone number. Address. What batch student is it? What courses are there after that? Like this and so on. You can think more about what attributes are related to students. So, all the attributes that you define are limited. How is it limited? Whatever type of database you are making. If you are making a university database. So, you will define the needed attributes of students in it. You will not define any attributes. So, you will not make the database bulky. You will make the database precise. So, you will define or use the same attributes. Which are necessary for students. Which are necessary to describe student data. Another example of entity is customer. There is a customer on the online site. So, what will be that? Customer ID. Contact number. The details of his address. We have to deliver it. Right. His date of birth. Some confidential information related to the customer. Basically, his email ID. Confidential as in it can be or not. It depends on what constraint we have put on the database. Email ID. And so on. In the same way, many attributes of your customer are defined. So, we understood what entity is. What are the attributes of entity. So, an entity is a real world object. Right. Which is distinguishable from other things. Right. We will understand this point in a while. Example, your student in a college is an entity. College can be an entity itself. Right. Now, there is one more property of entity. That it can be uniquely identified. Let's see its example. Now, you have students. There are many students in school or college. And you have stored their database. So, you want that every student can be uniquely identified. Why? Because, it is possible that student's name is same. That means, there are two different students. But their names are same. Right. One is named Rahul and the other is named Rahul. Or the third is named Rahul. There can be many Rahuls in school. There can be many Ajays. And so on. There can be many people. So, name will not define. Or it will not help in identifying me. It will not help in identifying that particular student. Right. Uniquely. So, what I will do is, I will choose one of the attributes of many students. I will define or choose such an attribute. Which will identify them uniquely. So, if I talk in real world terms. Which attribute in student helps in identifying them uniquely. That attribute is your student ID. Every student has a unique ID. Right. No two students have the same ID. So, that's why, there is one more property of entity. That is, the entity will have a unique ID. Similarly, the entity here, your customer, its unique ID is customer ID. Right. Now, we know why we need unique ID. Right. So, this is my customer's unique ID. Very good. Now, we will discuss about it further. The unique ID, this unique attribute, of any entity, I call it primary key. Right. So, it is a simple thing. That, entity can be uniquely identified by a primary attribute. Which I call primary key also. Such an attribute, which helps in uniquely identifying, I call it primary key. That's it. Right. Now, let's talk about entity set. Entity set, is not a big thing. Simply, the student, was an entity set. Reason being, you haven't stored any student in the database. You have a schema of student. Right. This is the schema, this is the design of student. That, this is student, these are its attributes. So, you will have many students who will confirm these attributes. You don't have one student. So, I call student as an entity set. That, this is a student entity set. This particular, is the basic set of, attributes, which defines the student. And, of the students we have, one of them will be, a single student, that's one entity. Right. Hence, the entity set, is, it is a set of entities, of same type, and that shares, same properties and attributes. Right. So, one student, in your student database, one student will be an entity. Right. And, many students, I call this schema, as entity set. Right. So, your collection of students which is same properties, same attributes, I call it as EntitySet. Now, when we are making ER diagram, we use entity and entity set in same way. We use same sense. These are in slang language. Actually, both are different. But when we are making ER model, we refer entity and entity set in same way. So, whenever we call entity set, we use same sense. Very good. Let's see the example. Entity set is student. It is an entity set. Customer of a bank is an entity set. Now, let's know about attributes. What are attributes? Attributes are attributes which are used to describe any entity. Repeatedly, we said that to define student, we need course, student ID, name, phone number, address, batch. So, these are its attributes. Similarly, customer ID, contact number, address, DOB, email, these are also its attributes. So, what do attributes do? Similarly, we define data. Attributes are used to define entity set. That's it. Nothing else. Attributes end here. Very good. Till now, we have learned what is entity. I call it entity set. And we have learned what are attributes. Entity is used to describe them. Now, this is done. Entity is used to describe them. Now, we will learn what is relationship. We have to study entire ER model. Entity, relationship, model. So, what are relationships? Now, in database, many things are stored. Many entities are stored. Like, database of a bank. There will be customers in it. Account of loan. Account details. There is a saving account. There is a current account. Many things. So, many things are there. Like, in your university, professor is an entity. Course is an entity. Students are an entity. So, many entities are there in this way. Now, entities are all different disjoints. Entity is different. All are uniquely identifiable in itself. And both are mutually exclusive. They are not dependent on each other. But, there is relationship between all entities. Like, I talked about relationship between data in database. So, what I call relationship? And how I define it in data model or ER diagram? Let's see that. Now, suppose you have a banking system. In that, I have customer is an entity. Okay. I call loan is an entity. Okay. Your account is an entity. I take these three entities. That means, database of customer. In my database, data of customer will be stored. Data of loan will be stored. Every loan will have loan ID. What is loan? What is car loan? What is loan? Such bank must have stored. There are many accounts in bank. Details about it. Who owns the account? What is the type of account? Okay. What is account number? And so on. Okay. Now, what will be the relationship between them? So, in ER diagram, I define relationship in this way. Like, I can say that customer borrow loan. So, there is a relation between customer and loan. Okay. Similarly, I can say that customer deposit account. That means, customers deposit in their account. Okay. Or withdraw. Withdraw is also a relation. There is a relation in deposit. So, there is a relation in banking system. Similarly, we discuss. Like, online ordering system. Like, what can be the relation in online ordering system? Customer places order. Okay. So, you order on Amazon or Food delivery app. So, customer is a different entity. Order is a different entity. What is the relation between them? Of places. Very good. If I talk about a university, then I can say that the professors in the university takes course. Okay. So, professor takes course. So, if I say that. Professor take courses. So, they teach them. Okay. Or I can say student enroll course. Students enroll courses. Okay. Similarly, if I talk on a macro level then I can say, a citizen of a country. Citizen, in citizen database. Citizen has vehicle. The vehicle has vehicle. So, this is a relation. So, basically, here is has relation, here is enroll relation, here is takes relation, place relation. We have written simple English statements and it is defining a relationship. A very good example is of the banking system that how the relation between customer, loan and account is defined. Now, in the term of ER diagram, let's see how we draw them or how we make them. This was my customer entity and this was my loan entity. The relation between them is always defined by diamond. I give the relation name as borrow and draw it like this. So, in the terms of ER diagram, I show the relationship between two entities, association in this way. So, customer, borrow, loan, I have defined it in the terms of ER diagram. The rest will also be defined like this, professor takes course. Similarly, customer places order. We define such a relationship. So, we talked about what is entity, what is entity set, what are the attributes of entities. And there is a relation between two entities. I will tell you all this by taking this. This comprises or this summarizes ER model. I call this ER model. Let's come to the definition once again. It is a high level model based on perception of real world that consists of collection of basic objects. We talked about the objects, entities, called entities and relationship among those objects. We talked about two entities, relationship between them. I call this ER model. That's it. Now, to represent ER model graphically, a very good thing is used which I call ER diagram. We are seeing how we draw ER diagram. We show the entity in the rectangle box. I show the relationship in diamond. We show the association with lines. What do we call ER diagram? ER diagram acts like a blueprint in DB. Whenever you have a question or task to design a database, first of all, you find entities in it. Then you find the attributes of those entities. Then you establish the relationship between them. Then you draw an entire ER diagram which acts like a blueprint. I can convert this ER diagram into tables or relational model. We will study about this in the future lectures. But why are we studying ER diagram? I was defining it. You must have understood that ER diagram acts like a blueprint. The actual design of the database in the form of tables will help me in that. So, we understood that ER diagram acts like a blueprint. Very good. Now, we will discuss that the attributes which are used to describe the data or the entity are of many types or have some properties. We will discuss about that. We will double click on attributes. We will see what are the attributes. We understood what are the attributes. Every attribute has a permitted value. Permitted value means that it has some consistency constraints or domain constraints. For example, the name of the customer cannot be null. In my database, in DB, the name of the customer cannot be null. The name of the customer should be there. If it is not there, it means that my DB is inconsistent. The story cannot be there in DB. Okay. Similarly, I will define the domain of your loan. The particular bank gives car loan, home loan and education loan. It gives three types of loans. It does not give personal loan. Just suppose. I will say that the loan, the loan ID or the loan account, in the attribute of the loan, where I will store that it is a car loan or education loan or home loan, I cannot enter my personal loan in that entry. So, I have defined the domain of the loan. One of these three values can be one. Your personal loan or business loan cannot be in this type of entry. Okay. So, I can say that in every attribute, this is my attribute, there is some domain. Domain and values. This is a domain. What are the values that can be taken? There are some permitted values and non-permitted values. What are the values that are permitted? What are the non-permitted values? In short, the name of the customer cannot be numeric. The name of someone cannot be 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay. So, these are some consistency constraints. I have put some constraints in it. Why are constraints helpful? They keep my database consistent. Okay. Now, a database has been created in which I have said that the name of the customer is numeric. It cannot be numeric. But that database is so badly designed. There are no constraints in it that by mistake, the entry of the numeric name has gone. So, when you will try to retrieve the data, you will see the name of the customer 1, 2, 3, 4. If you see such a name, then it is not a real-world thing. Why are we doing programming? Why do we do the design, business, and store the data? Everything is that it is easy for humans. It is easy for us. Operations are easy. So, you are seeing that there is an entry which is inconsistent. So, you are not able to define it properly. You are not able to define the broken customer. Okay. You are getting an illegal entry. So, such things should not happen. There are some constraints. You have to confirm them. Okay. Very good. After student attributes, I had already discussed that how many attributes students have. After that, we discuss types of attributes. Now, how many types of attributes? Let's talk about types of attributes. We will understand it with a very good example. Before that, let's go straight to notes and understand. The most important type of types of attributes is simple type. Simple means such attributes which I am not able to further divide. Okay. There are many attributes which I am not able to further divide. The example of which is customer's account number in a bank. Now, the customer's account number is of 10 digits. Now, I can't withdraw any other meaning from the first 5 digits. Or I can't withdraw any other meaning from the last 5 digits. I will use 10 digits as a whole. Then I will know about the customer's account. Similarly, I can't further divide the student's role number. So, these are simple attributes. Nothing simple. There is nothing special to discuss. Now, the second is very important. Composite. Composite means such attributes which I can divide into subparts. Okay. What is in it? Name of a person. How can a person's name be divided? First name, middle name, last name. Okay. So, this is your name. I can divide it. Now, you will see that why is there a need to divide the name? Now, you will ask why should I divide a name? I simply store it completely. The benefit of dividing a name is that sometimes when you have a system which you have made a software. A software system is designed. Sometimes you want to access only the last name. Okay. I want to get data points like this. Let's assume that the last name is Mukharji. So, I want to get all the names whose last name is Mukharji. So, I want to get all the names whose last name is Mukharji. I want to get these names. I want to get the last name of Mukharji. So, I'll put it in a name like this. I'll put in a name like this. So, I'll put in a name like this. And it will be beneficial. It's very classic example of this. Address. You can divide the address in street, city, state, pin code. Okay? What will be the benefit after dividing? I want to have particular citizens who live in particular pin code or zip code. Okay. So, I want to list them. Remember. We had discussed in the first lecture that we had discussed the problems of file system. I have you in my mind. Okay. So, I want to list them. Remember. In the previous video, I discussed about the problem. In that, there was an example that if a policeman comes and asks you for details about the people who live in the zip code. I was not able to find those details in the case of file system. I had to write a particular program. But in DB, it is stored separately. Address is stored as a composite attribute. After storing, things become very easy that I can refer it separately. Some system may want to refer separately. And some system may want to refer all the subparts of the address together. So, they will be referable together. So, it is written here that if the user wants to refer an entire attribute, it can be done. If a particular component wants to be referred, it can be done. This is the composite. Next type is single-valued. Single-valued is the same as simple. Only one value can be of that particular attribute. Like student ID can be one value. And so on. If it is a loan number, then it can be a loan. Only one loan number can be. If student ID is 737, then it will be 737737. It is not like that student has 743 ID also. Only one ID can be of that particular student. Now, opposite of this is multi-valued. Such attributes which have multiple values. For example, phone number. If you are storing the phone number of the customer, then there can be many phone numbers. We can store an alternate number also. But I don't want that. I want that in one entry or in one attribute, I can store all the things. So, ER model provides me a configuration that I can make multi-valued attributes also. Like phone number, nominee name. It can be multiple nominees. In the policy of dependent name, you have made your parents dependent. So, you will tell two parents. So, these are multi-valued attributes. So, nominee name or dependent name is multi-valued. Now, in multi-valued, you can also put a limit constraint. How much will be the upper bound of multi-valued? You will say that your nominee can be two only. Or you will say that there should be at least one nominee. So, in this way, you can define upper and lower limits. Now, comes your derived attribute. Now, what is a derived attribute? Derived attribute is an attribute which I can derive from other related attributes. Confusion happened. It will be understood very easily. Age. Age attribute is a derived attribute. Suppose, you have stored the date of birth of your customer or student. Now, when you have stored the date of birth, you can calculate the age by calculating current date. You can calculate the particular age by calculating the DOB. Similarly, loan age. How much time has been the loan? If I am asking from the database that this is the loan of the car. How much time has been the loan? In this case, I will have that when the loan was disbursed. When the loan was disbursed. From that time to today, I can calculate the date by calculating the date. What is the age of the loan? What is the membership period? How many members are there? I can calculate it in this way. So, your derived attributes are there. Now, in this one ER diagram, we will see a very good example. This particular example of types of attributes. First of all, what is the entity here? It is my customer. Now, let's see which are the composite attributes in this. Composite attribute is your address. How is the address composite? There are four parts of the address. First is street. Second is city. Third is state. Fourth is zip code. Now, look carefully. The street that I have, I have divided it into subparts. It is also made composite. I can also do nesting like this. The composite of the street can be street name, street number. Now, pay attention. Whenever you are making an address attribute, make sure that in front of the interviewer or whatever DB you are going to design in the near future, you store the address in this way. You make it composite. The more composite you make, the better it will be. The more you will be able to manage things in a good way. So, this is a very good example of storing the address. Similarly, we give single valued. Single valued will be your customer ID. It is also simple. Customer ID will be there that you can not divide it. Now, the second comes multi-valued. Here, phone number. This is multi-valued attribute. Look carefully. The attribute of the phone number, I have made two ellipses like this. Okay. Nested two ellipses. So, in the same way, you define multi-valued attribute in ER diagram. So, you have to note that you have to make two concentric ellipses. Okay. Only then you can define it as multi-valued attribute. How is multi-valued? Phone number can be multiple. Okay. Now, comes my second. This name. The name is also composite here. Okay. Now, fourth is derived. How is derived? Derived attribute is here, age. Look carefully at the age. Dotted ellipse is made. Dotted. Dotted ellipse means that here I have age, which is a derived attribute. What is derived? I can derive related attribute, DOB from it. I can derive age from date of birth. So, I made it a derived attribute. So, it is a very classic example. It is a very good example to define all types of attributes, to understand them. So, you draw it and remember it. Very good. Now, we will discuss what null means in ER model. Null. Null value. Okay. What does null value mean? Let's go straight to notes. Null value means an attribute whose value is not assigned yet or the value of the attribute is not there yet. And it is not a value, it has three meanings. First, it indicates that it is not applicable. That particular value is not applicable. Okay. For example, it may be that we made composite attribute, name. So, it indicates that it is not applicable. Law due to charge. The second reason behind this is that his value is not applicable. Okay. Move on the fourth reason for this column. The third one is that you have already tried. So, it will be easy to understand that where does it realize. And that theta office is tea office. Okay. But for both other reason, \u0448\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d \u044d\u043e\u0440. It is domestic. It means that she belongs to there and she is living there. What is it, For example, we see that so, we have the index value. Okay. And then above there is except. That is, it is e\u015fem. Second null value means unknown. Unknown means that your particular entry is missing. Like we discussed here, you have deleted the name of the customer. Name is null. And I have said this constraint that the name of the customer should be there. So in this case, I will say that null value shows that the name is unknown. The particular entry of the customer name is missing. It means that there should be some value but it is missing for now. It means that there is some inconsistency or problem. Very good. Second is not known. Null can also mean that it is not known. It depends on the base of every attribute. Like we discussed that the name cannot be null. The name cannot be null even when I said that the name of the customer is not null. It means that it is missing. Similarly, if there is no middle name, then what consistency constraint will be applied? If there is no middle name, then it means that it is not applicable. It means that there is no middle name of the particular person. It is okay. Third is not known. What does it mean? Suppose it is the database of the employee. Now the name of the employee, the address of the employee, the ID of the employee. But the salary attribute is not known. The salary is not defined yet. Or its onboarding process is still going on. The salary is not yet agreement on it. So in that case, if the salary attribute is null, it means that it is not known yet. So it depends on the usage. What is the type of that attribute? What constraints have you defined? On that behalf, null behaves. It can also show not applicable depending upon what constraints you have kept. It can also show unknown. There can be a missing entry in unknown. Or it is not known yet. Very good. Now let's double click on relationships. Like we read relationship. Customer borrow loan. This is a relationship. Now let's double click. Let's talk about relationships. Let's discuss relationships briefly. We had discussed it a little while ago. What is this? The association between two or more entities. Similar example. Your person has vehicle. So what is the association between them? What is the relation? Has. Person has vehicle. Very good. The same parent has child. Customer borrow loan. Now there are two types of relations. First is strong relationship. Strong relationship. Strong relationship. Second is weak relationship. Second is weak relationship. But before we double click on this thing, we have to understand what are strong and weak entities. Okay. We had studied entities. Strong entity is an entity which is independent. Independent as in in the whole system, whatever you are making the DB system, it has independent existence. Like in the university system, the particular student had independent existence. Now what is the meaning of independent existence? That particular student can be recognized by an attribute. That particular student can be recognized by a primary key. What was there in the primary key? Student ID. Okay. So this particular entity is called strong entity. Okay. This is a strong entity. Very good. Now what is the weak entity? Like we were able to recognize strong entity with primary key. We cannot recognize weak entity with primary key. It does not have primary key. As in a weak entity is dependent on strong entity. Okay. That means weak entity has existence only when strong entity exists. Okay. This is a very beautiful example of this. There is a rule states that hold of lone and load is must be valid. Think about this. If only you are engaged to a strong entity is best function to do when my seed technically hasn chili tap. China is just mounted, even though you will son by a technical system, we can do this. Huan is ready for me. You go to through 3 million program able to do stay in india. I am not expecting it. You come to know to invest in the future in your own water project or with familyinizi custom \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d with money possibilities. Everyone has this policy. But every loan has a corresponding payment system. That means there will be a payment schedule. Because whenever you take a loan, like you took a car loan for 1 year, and it costs 12 lakhs, and I am not calculating the interest rate, then you have to pay EMI of 1 lakh. You pay EMI of 1 lakh per month. You have to pay it for 12 months. So, it has a complete schedule. So, you have to pay 12 payments in total. So, I have to pay 12 payments for 1 loan. Payment number. I have to pay 12 payments. So, now look carefully. If there is no loan, loan is a strong entity. If there is no loan, then is there a payment schedule? No. Okay. There is a payment system only when my loan exists. Okay. So, I can say that payment is a weak entity. And I will design it in such a way that it has a particular, a particular attribute. There will be no primary attribute. There will be no primary key. Okay. The dotted line you can see, the payment number, this is also its weak primary key. I mean, it is a weak key. Which is defining. It starts like 1, 2, 3, 4, like a sequential counter. Okay. As I can say, the installments of EMI can be a sequential number, which can be generated from a simple counter. And suppose, if someone has taken a car loan, then the EMI's payment schedule will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, such a schedule. Similarly, if someone has taken a home loan, suppose, in this loan, the type is home loan, then the payment schedule of that loan will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, I cannot uniquely identify the payment. That means, there will be many payment schedules. Okay. There is a separate payment schedule of home loan. There is a separate payment schedule of car loan. Okay. And their payment number can also be the same. That means, the first installment of home loan is payment number 1. The first installment of car loan is payment number 1. So, I cannot uniquely identify them. So, what I have done is, I have made them weak entity. How is a weak entity defined? I make two concentric rectangles like this. And I associate it with loan. That the existence of a weak entity is only when there is a particular loan. Okay. Now, there will be a loan, then only, there will be a payment schedule, then only, there will be a payment number. Okay. That's why, the association that I have shown between them, has made a weak relation. I make it with concentric diamond. Like this, there are two weak relations. When will the payment exist? Payment. The existence of payment is only when there is a loan. Okay. So, I can say in this way, the relation between payment and loan, the relation between payment and loan, is a weak relation. Okay. So, we have defined that, what is a strong entity? It can be uniquely identified. It is primary. What is a weak entity? It cannot be uniquely identified. It is not primary. We understood its classic example. Okay. Let's talk about strong relation. So, as we have simply discussed many relations before, customer places, order, this is a strong relation. Okay. Because, the customer has an independent existence. He has a primary key, customer ID. The order has a primary key, its own, order ID. So, this is a strong relation. Similarly, professor and course also have a strong relation. Professor ID can be there. Okay. The course ID of such a course will be there. So, we have read very well about strong and weak relation. Now, let's discuss, what is degree of relation? Degree of relation. Degree of relation means, how many participants are there in a particular relation? How many entities are participating in a particular relationship? For example, in this particular relation, this relation of has, two entities are participating in it. Okay. Similarly, in the relation of customer and order, in the relation of places, two entities were participating. So, I call it binary relationship. Similarly, I have unary relation and I have a ternary relationship. Okay. We will discuss this. First of all, let's talk about what is unary relation? Unary relationship can be in which there is only one participant. Okay. A simple example of this can be, in an organization, the employee manages himself. Employee manages employee. That means, there will be a manager in any employee. Okay. The same manager will manage the employees. So, similarly, this is the unary relation. Second is binary relation. We have seen many examples of binary relationship from the beginning. Okay. Student takes course. Okay. I will show you binary relationship quickly. These are all binary relations. Customer, borrow loan. Okay. There are two entities in the borrow relationship. There are two entities in the deposit relationship. Okay. Professor and in the tax relationship, there are two entities. Okay. So, these are all your binary relationships. So, from the beginning, we are discussing binary relationship. Now, it is very interesting to know your ternary relationship. How do we see ternary relationship? In one relationship, three entities are participating. Okay. Let's see its good example. So, this is your example of ternary relationship. Okay. So, this is your example of ternary relationship. Okay. One line is left. This. Now, look carefully. How is your ternary relationship? Employee works on branch. Employee, we mean the employees of a bank, they work on some branch. Okay. This works on your relation. There is a job in it. The employee works on a job. They are placed on a job. There is a job role. Okay. So, this is the ternary relationship. Now, let's see the ternary relationship. So, this is the ternary relationship. Okay. So, this is the ternary relationship. Okay. So, this is the ternary relationship. Another ternary relationship. So, in this one of these ternary relationship, you can see that you can't have it in different ways. This is like the ternary relationship. This relationship is also your identity relationship. So, Gebote\u0442 is your, true identity relationship. toxic\ucc30 relative relationship and Age So, your focus should be on identifying binary relationship. Now, we will discuss about relationship constraints. Relationship constraints. This topic is also going to be interesting. The first constraint is called mapping cardinality. What does mapping cardinality mean? Let's go to notes. It means number of entities to which another entity can be associated via a relationship. That means, how many numbers of entity of one entity which is the number of numbers of entity of another entity. How many numbers of entity of another entity are associated with another entity. There will be some confusion. Let's discuss it directly. First of all, my 1 to 1. 1 to 1 means, suppose I have two entity sets A and B. It means, one entity of entity set A will be associated with one entity of entity set B. That's it. It won't happen that two entities of entity set A will be associated with or one entity of entity set B. It's prime example is Citizen has Aadhaar card. If I want to draw it, I will draw it like this. Suppose this is Citizen set and this is Aadhaar set. Okay. There will be many citizens here. Suppose there will be many citizens here. A1, A2, A3, A4, A4 and so on. There will be many in the same Aadhaar card. B1, B2, B3, B4. Okay. What is A1? Citizen A. What is B1? Another citizen. Okay. These are all entities. This entire entity set is. Similarly, in the Aadhaar set, there is one Aadhaar card, one Aadhaar card, and one Aadhaar card. After every citizen, there is one Aadhaar card. So, if I will make its mapping cardinality, then it will be with A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3. So, it means that one entity of citizen entity set is associated with one entity of Aadhaar card entity set. That's it. So, I call it 1 to 1 mapping. 1 to 1 cardinality. So, its cardinality will be 1 to 1. Okay. Second, you have 1 to many. This means that entity in A is associated with an entity in B. Okay. While entity in B is associated with at most one entity in A. Okay. Let's see its example. Its example will be simple. Citizen has car. I will quickly draw its example. One is too many. This is citizen entity set. This is your vehicle entity set. Okay. A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4. Okay. So, I can say that 1 is to n. That means one citizen can have multiple cars. But one car will be owned by one citizen. Okay. So, if I will make its mapping. So, A1 means that it has B1 car, B2 car, and B3 car. But now look carefully. B3, B2, B1 are mapped with one citizen. So, 1 is to n means that one entity can be connected with multiple. But if I will go right to left, then it will be n is to 1. That means that particular entity will be associated with one entity. Okay. Similarly, I can draw the rest. This can also be in it. This can also be. And so on. Okay. This is 1 is to n. Okay. The third one is n is to 1. Okay. What is n is to 1? Let's draw n is to 1 also. Let's see it with a straight example. Suppose there is a course and you have a professor. Okay. There are many courses. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5. There is a professor. Suppose there is P1, P2, P3, P4. Okay. What does this mean? This means that the entity set of your course. In that. Your association will look something like this. That C1 course teaches P1 professor. C2 course also teaches P1 professor. So you will see that two courses are associated with one entity. Okay. Two courses are associated with one entity in the professor set. Okay. But you will see vice versa. So one professor is associated with multiple. So if I see left to right view. So one course is taught by one professor. Okay. And if I see right to left view. So one professor can teach multiple courses. Okay. So this will be the mapping cardinality of n is to 1. Fifth is n is to m. What does this mean? Entity in A is associated with an entity in B. While entity in B is also associated with an entity in A. Okay. Let's see its example. Customer. Customer and product. Okay. If we draw directly. These are my customers. These are my products. C1, C2, C3, C4, 5, C6. P1, P2, P3, 5, P6. So what should I say? One customer can buy multiple products. Okay. Similarly, one product can be bought by multiple customers. Okay. So this is your example of n is to n. That is, many to many mapping. Another example of this is student attend courses. That is, one student can attend multiple courses. Okay. And one course can be attended by multiple students. Okay. So this is your many to many. So now we will discuss about participation constraint. Okay. What is participation constraint? Let's come to notes. It is also called minimum cardinality constraint. Okay. It has two types. Let's understand it by its types. Okay. The first type is total participation. It is based on the name. Total participation means that the entity set of each entity in any entity set will be connected to at least one relationship instance. That is, all entities will be involved in that relationship in at least one relationship instance. Okay. Its opposite, partial participation means that it is not necessary that all entities in the entire entity set are taking part in that particular relationship instance. Okay. Let's understand its classic example. Between customer and loan. There is a relation of borrow between customer and loan. Okay. Now look carefully. These particular double lines have been made. It means total participation. Okay. Now what is total participation? Now look carefully. Between customer and loan, there is a relation of borrow. So loan is an entity set. So entity set means there will be many loans. Okay. Now when there will be many loans, then every loan will be borrowed by a customer. That is, it cannot happen that any entity will be involved in that. Okay. So the loan will be borrowed by a customer. Okay. So there will be a loan in this entity set. There is a loan entity set. There will be L1, L2, L3, there will be many loans in it. There cannot be any loan in it which is not connected to the customer entity through this relationship. Okay. There cannot be any loan without any reason. Right. That such loan is there in the bank system which is not being repaid. Which is not taken by any customer. Okay. There cannot be such entry. So this is a constraint. That is why I am telling you that there is no such entry in the bank system. Okay. So this is a constraint. So this is a constraint. That is why I am telling you that this is a participation constraint. Which I am also calling a total participation. That all loans in the loan entity set, each loan, at least one customer must have taken. Okay. Similarly, this constraint is a partial constraint. That is, partial participation. Partial participation means that your customers can also be in the entity set. There can be such customers who have not taken any loan. If they have not taken any loan. Okay. So, they are partially involved in this relationship. Okay. That is, this particular entity set is in this relationship with a partial constraint. They are with a partial participation constraint. So, the relation of the customer to the loan is a partial participation. Okay. That is, I can say that the relation of the customer to the loan is a partial participation. Okay. So, the relation of the loan to the customer is a partial participation. Okay. But the relation of the loan to the customer is a total participation. We have understood this. Why? Because such a customer can be in the entity set. That is, in the customer entity set who has not taken any loan. So, this is a partial participation. But such a loan cannot be in the system if any customer has not taken it. Okay. So, this is a constraint. So, the relation of the loan to the customer is a partial participation. Very good. Now, there is a very beautiful thing. The weak entities always come with a partial participation constraint. Weak entities come with a partial participation constraint. I forgot to write one thing here. But strong entity. May not have total. What does it mean? The weak entities will always come with a total participation. Okay. But strong entity is not necessary to come with a total participation. Their total participation can also be there. Their partial participation can also be there. Let's see an example. The weak entity has always total constraint. We just read about weak entity and strong entity. We read about weak relation. Our loan and payment had a weak relation. Okay. So, in this case, we saw that the payment has total participation with this relationship. That is, the payment entry or the payment entity set will have the information of payment only when it will be connected to a loan. That is, the payment will only be there when the loan will be there. Okay. There can be no such payment schedule in the system. There can be no such payment schedule in the system. Which is not connected to any loan. So, in this relationship, in this weak relationship, the payment is with a total participation. Very good. So, we understood. This was my last point. That weak entity comes with total participation. That is, you have to keep in mind that whenever you are making a weak entity, it will always come with a total participation constraint. That is, it will get a double arrow. But strong entity is not necessary. Got it? The strong entity we made here is also a strong entity. This is also a strong entity. This is also a strong entity. Okay. Its relationship with this is that of partial participation. And the same has a correlation with the loan borrow. It has a total participation with it. That is, it is very good. All the notations. All the symbols we use here. All symbols we have used here. This is the entity. This is the weak entity. attribute, multi-valued attribute, primary key, weak attribute. Now you are confused about weak attribute when it doesn't have any attribute. So, as we discussed, your weak entity also has a kind of primary key. It is not primary key but it also exists when you have a loan instance. So, we call it weak attribute. So, in this weak entity also there is a determining attribute. Derived attribute is dotted like this. We discussed about age. This is relationship. You show total participation like this. And weak relationship looks like this. Very good. So, this was our lecture number 3. It is also very long. In the next lecture, we will discuss about enhanced ER notation. Enhanced ER feature in which we will discuss about generalization and specialization. After that, we will practice making ER diagrams. We will make ER diagrams of 2-3 systems by ourselves. And we will see how things go ahead. How we design ER diagrams. What are the things in mind. How mind map is done. You have given a question. We have to make ER diagram. So, how I will select entity. How I will make attributes of entity. How I will find relationships. We will discuss about all these in elaborate way. So, we will meet in next lecture. Till then, good bye."

Hello, how are you all, this is Lakshya and we have come to my DBMS lecture number 14 and today we are going to discuss performance optimization technique in DBMS I have to optimize the database, let's understand about this So what happens to you, suppose you have this database I am saying database where information is stored, basically it is stored in disk In disk, your blocks will have table stored, right which logically will be your table, suppose student's data will be here This is DBMS layer, you are sitting here You are inside the laptop Ok You write query, you write SQL query, use select, use where Ok, you put query on some table like this And you give query to DBMS and what DBMS does is It brings data from the table, that is, the actual data file that is stored in the file system And beautifies you on this layer and shows you on the screen Ok, we understand this thing, we are trying to understand this thing for a long time Right So tell me one thing that this data file is in disk Ok This file will be in some disk, something will be written in the file Ok You need some specific information, you need specific tuples, ok You need this tuple or you need some set of tuples This is what you do in queries by writing star or by applying some clause or by group by You try to make tuples that I get information, right So if I go directly to this information and fetch it Then it is a little slow process because the data file is in the file system The file system is in your disk, the access to the disk is a little slow So there is a better way of indexing than that That I put a layer This is like some caching, I will not call it caching But you can relate it in some way to understand What will you do? That rather than, suppose your student had a table here in the disk Ok There were many tuples stored in the disk There were many tuples stored in the disk Suppose there are one lakh students So what do you do? You make an index file here Index file Ok Here you write the roll number and here you write the base pointer And you Specifically for any roll number Like if the roll number is 1, 2 or 5 Specifically you go and find it in the data block That where is the information of this So I can access it fast How does it happen? I don't have to search from the beginning in the disk I don't have to search linearly Ok It is a little confusing I am going to tell you this example I will draw it nicely once Then I will explain it to you It will be nice This video is sponsored by Cryo Cryo is a world's leading work experience based learning platform Where you can enhance your software skills And you can also grab top dev jobs Unlike usual courses In Cryo you are going to learn full stack development or backend development But by building industry level projects In a real developer environment At the end of their programs you will have made many projects Which will make your resume more effective And will also become a strong github profile You are in full stack development What all techs are you going to use in backend development All of that is also visible here And you are also going to get personalized career assistance So that your dream job is double surety What you have to do is I will attach a link in the description By using it you can take maximum possible discount on Cryo programs And you can also unlock some free resources So we will go to the description Use the link Grab a placement And give me a party So book your free trial now I was trying to explain something In disk you have a data file It is also called main file or data file You can also call it database file You can call it anything In disk information is stored in blocks Block 1, block 2, block nth block Now suppose you have a total of 10,000 records Means 10,000 tuples Suppose this is a student's database I have 10,000 students stored in a data file Assume something like this And because I said Things are stored in blocks in the disk So 10 records are stored in one block I can say Each block has 10 records I can say like this So how many blocks will I have in total So how many total blocks will I have 1000 Simple math Now suppose you have a query Give me 15th student Give me 11th student How will you search? How will you search? Now suppose Because it was a roll number Roll number is of primary Assume it is of primary What is assumed? It is normally of primary So if it is of primary Then it will be sorted I can understand this It will be sorted Now because it will be sorted So what will you do? You can do one thing first Do you want 11th student or nth student So you can search linearly in the data file You can search linearly No issue Now whoever has read your searching and sorting He will say why linearly When things are sorted Then why can't I put binary search Yes, you can put it You can also put binary search in it What you do You go to the middle point Then you see It was smaller or bigger than that And you switch to that block So by doing this You can put binary search there If someone has not read Then once you google binary search You will understand What is binary search Linear search and binary search So because this file was sorted Then the best thing I could put binary search Yes You could put binary search You must be looking fast But suppose you don't have 10000 You have 1 lakh 2 lakh 3 lakh 10 lakh 1 crore You have so many students You have so many records Ok So now how will you manage this How can you access it fast If I say I want nth student So how can I make it fast Access it To that student's tuple Like 11th student So it will have more information Student's name Age Name Class Course id etc All other attributes Ok So how can I reach the rest of the data So for that What I do I use a data structure Ok I use a data structure Which I call Index I call it index Simply The name of this data structure is Index How does it work So we can store information In such a structure What is this information Storing Look carefully You have Role number Ok Search key Search key Ok And you have base pointer Of which Of a block In which This particular After one Which is one particular Role number In which block Is stored Now understand carefully We have already said This thing is sorted Ok We have already said It is sorted Now because it is sorted So If I have one I will store in base pointer So after one Whatever is in this block One two three four five six seven eight nine ten I can I can quickly fetch it Ok This is with this assumption Because Data file You can be very big But the block Is a block Block is small So somehow If I know the base pointer of the block I can find out That I have this particular Role number In which block If I take out this thing So in that block Searching Not much work for me I can search it linearly Or there I can search by using binary search Ok So Let's understand again What was the first Index table Nothing like that Index was nothing What were you doing You have to find some nth student So what are you doing Simply you are Doing binary search On the whole file When you are doing binary search on the whole file Whatever time you are taking Log base two n Whatever time you will take Ok What am I doing better than that That I By index File I That block Find out I will store the base pointer of that block Find out that block Quickly got the block So I will do binary search inside that block So you understand The second approach It is seen fast I see fast Once you complete the whole index table Then understand Then you will understand better So what are we doing Rule number one Which block is stored B1 block is stored Ok Its base pointer I have located here B1 I call it base pointer 11th Its base pointer is B2 This is its base pointer Ok Twenty first Let's consider it B3 Its base pointer will be somewhere here And this is your B1000 Its base pointer will be somewhere here Ok Now I have made some structure I have made some arrangement like this What was this This is inside your disk What is this index file This can also be inside your disk Or you can load it in RAM Ok Doesn't matter There is no issue Now let's understand Suppose You have an example You have to find out 843 students I need information corresponding to 843 students So how will you find out If you don't have an index table Then what will you do What you do Simply You do a linear search on all Or you do a binary search You do it on all objects You do it on all records Now what is better than that That I At a small place At a small place At a small place Once Linear Basically I do a binary search Now Index table Index table itself is sorted Always keep this in mind Index table will always be sorted What is the benefit of being sorted If the data file is not sorted Then If the data file is not sorted Then If the data file is also non-sorted Then Either we make it sorted So that we can put a binary search here Okay This is the benefit of being sorted You put a binary search You get saved from linear search Okay You reduce the time Okay So it's better That you are on the whole Instead of searching You first search on this This index file is always small That's why it's useful Index file will be small That's why it will be useful If I index all the records Then it will be useful It will not be useful It will take the same time When all the records I have to search in the index All records will be there So If I index all the records Then I have to search all the records I have to search all the records In the data file The only thing What we have done here In the index file Decreased the records Basically Decreased the search How will the search be reduced Now I want 843 Okay So Where will I get 843 843 Where will I get 843 In 841st block In 841st block In 841st block In 841st block In 841st block Okay So What will you do now Now In a small place Okay In a small place How many will be here How many records will be there In the index file So How many records will be there in the index file 1000 So What will you do first First step In 1000 Search And which search will be Binary search Okay What will you do after searching That 841 What is the corresponding base pointer of the search key B841 Sorry 843 Its corresponding Was B841 Now What will you do You get up And Get this information And You Go to 841st block How can I go to 841st block Because I have stored its base pointer in the index table I will go here And Go to 842 Plus 8 Sorry 842 Then 843 I will search this I will put Binary search Or Binary search So It's better That you Use the index file To reduce your search space And After reducing Go to that block And Go to the block And Put binary search And retrieve the things In this way Indexing Your Data Access Fastens Okay So this was a small example To understand Why is your indexing important What is the benefit Okay I repeat it again 843 You had to find the student So If indexing Is not there So what would I do I would Put the search on 10000 records 10000 Records For The search query I would put A query of search I would put Linear search Binary search Let's take Binary search It is sorted So I would put binary search Now it's better That I On 1000 Items Which is in the index table I put binary search On the item Bsearch And After that I In that particular Block Which was 841th block I put binary search And find things Okay So simple So in this way I am reducing my search effort I am reducing my access Okay I am searching in disk I am searching in index file I am directly Reaching that block And I am able to find things Okay I hope you understand What I am saying Okay Let's go to notes once Let's understand What is written What does indexing do Your performance optimization We understood It reduces disk access How it reduces We understood One minute ago Okay Index type What is in the index table It is simply a data structure Which is useful for Locating data Okay Basically If we talk about Queries of your SQL So search queries And where clause Okay Wherever it is used Where read operation is used Searching is happening Queries Data files Where data file Accesses and retrieves Data In those cases Indexing helps you a lot Okay By default SQL Whatever implementation Indexing is involved Let's move forward We understood Search What is search It can be of primary It can be of candidate Or something else Okay Any attribute can be Based on that search You get the data reference Okay What was the search here Here was the search Role number Okay And here Which is In your data file Role number Here Your primary Or search Can say So this is the search Search Corresponding Now there is a pointer Which is on that blog Or on that data reference Address Doing Pointing on it I can directly access it Let's move forward Now This thing Understand this thing carefully Indexing is optional Okay You know That brother If there is a very small Small database Then you must not Indexing Okay When the data is very big Then only the indexing Is useful Okay But increases Access speed Okay It is optional But it increases the speed It is not the primary Mean To access the tuple It is the secondary Mean What does it mean That you Tuple You need 843 students You can go directly You can search By Or You can search But a secondary method Which is more Optimized Is fast You used That brother You first went to the index table Searched You took its base pointer B8841 Go there On that blog You At 843 Corresponding Whatever information Was Other tuples Other attributes You took all that Okay Very good Now index file Always sorted So that You Binary search Apply Okay If you Make an index file Your option Is that you Make it Unshorted Then it has no Benefit You have to put linear Search in Unshorted Because you know That its Complexity Is high Okay Bias Always better Than Linear Search Very good Now let's understand About types of indexing Types of Indexing Let's understand This From a note What is primary index We call it Clustering index Okay Now Some people Who have read about Clustering index Or indexing That primary and Clustering Are different But Don't confuse Let's understand Okay What is primary index That It applies At those places Or on those data files Or on those use cases Where My data file Data file Is sequentially ordered So This is The example of Sequential order This is Sequentially ordered On the base of One key On the base of One key On the base of One attribute It is Sorted Basically So in that case I can apply This Primary indexing So I can say That Your primary indexing You will apply Where Your data file Is sorted On the base of One key So If you have Student table In that You have Role number Age Name So if you Sort it According to age So it is possible What is possible Mostly it will be That your Role number Will be Unsorted Or if you Sort it According to Role number Then age Will be Unsorted Okay So on the base of One key You have Here This Role number Searched So On the base of This Role number It is Ordered Okay Now listen carefully The term Primary index Is sometimes Used to mean On index On primary Okay This is A big sin It means That It is not Standard Primary means Not from Primary Not from Primary So If You Sort Your Data On that attribute Then Your Data File Is Sorted Okay It is not That Primary Indexing Will Apply On your Primary Key Or The Primary Key Will Apply On your Primary Key In this case We have Primary Key But there is no restriction That Primary Key Will Apply On your Primary Indexing It is not A standard You can Apply Non Primary Key On your Primary Indexing Okay We will read The Type Of Index Which Is Dense Index And Sparse Index Okay It is Very Easy To Understand This What Does Dense Index Means The Dense Index Contains An Index Of 4 Entries Of 5000 And 10,000 If It Is Of 10,000 Then I Call It Dense Indexing Means I Have All Data Files Indexed Okay Now You Think What Is This In This Table In Index File Your Present As An Entry So I Call It Dense Indexing Second Is Sparse Indexing What Is Sparse Indexing An Index Record Here Is So You Have In Gap Of 10 10 You Have Gave The First Key Of The Block So This Is Pass Indexing You Have Not Created Entry In This Table You Can Understand Things Further Very Good Primary Indexing Can Be Based On Data File Is Sorted With Respect To Primary Key Attribute And Non Primary Key Attribute Is Based On Key Attribute In The First Case Of The Ordering Of Data File Is Based On Key Attribute Of The Role Number Page Now We Have The Role Number Page In This Page And In This Page We Have Data File Of The Student And The Role Number Is Based On The Role Number Of The Student And The Role Number Is Based On The Key At The Key And The Role Number Is Based On The Key And The Role Number Is Based On The Role Number And The Role Number Is Based On The Role Number Of The Student In This Page And The Role Number Of The Student In The Page Of The Student Is Based On The Work About The Student And The Same Approach Than How Should To Choose\u6307 Role Of D Ay Work In The Diary , Ha It Scattered Certain \u0422 Work By Having A about indexing. So why am I saying this? Because this type of indexing is called clustering indexing by many writers or blogs on the internet. And they call it clustering indexing and say that this is not a part of primary indexing. This is something else. This is a second type. But I am saying that this is not a different type. I call primary indexing as clustering indexing. And primary indexing is actually a very macro level term. It is an abstract term. In primary indexing, it says that it should be sorted on someone's base. It can be sorted on the base of key or on the basis of non key attribute. So I made two distinctions. It is sorted on the basis of key. So something like this will happen. It will happen on the basis of non key. But some writers say that the method of sorting on the basis of non key I am going to tell you now is also called clustering indexing. And what am I saying? I am calling all of them primary index. So don't get confused. Just understand the concept. So what will happen if I sort it on the basis of non key? So there are some such examples. Let's understand what I am trying to say. So we said that your file is sorted. Based on some non key attribute. Now because it is sorted on the basis of non key attribute. So we know that those particular attributes The values \u200b\u200bcan also be repeated. Duplicate values \u200b\u200bcan be. Okay. That is, what is your attribute of non in your student table? Name. So the name can be repeated. The name of two people can be Rahul. So here we have sorted the file on the basis of non key attribute. In which one one one two three three three four four four five by doing this. We have written here. Now how will I do indexing in this? Okay. In this, we do indexing in this way. That brother you write the corresponding of one. You write the base pointer. In which block first one showed me. Now because it is sorted. So if I see one once, then after that the corresponding values \u200b\u200bare there. I will get it after one. That is, what did I do? Which block did I first show the corresponding of one? Showed me in B1 block. Now if it was shown in B1 block, then I took this pointer and stored it. Now suppose I wanted to give the corresponding of one which is the attribute of one non. Give all the corresponding values \u200b\u200bof it. That is, I want all the corresponding values \u200b\u200bof it. So how will I give? I will go to one. I will reach B1. Once I got one to reach. After that, I will go to the next next block and go to the next next address and keep looking until one does not end. So I got three ones. So I return all this information through query. I will return. Now you will say that where is the need for clustering indexing? Why should I do indexing on the basis of non-key? This is the reason why it is required. Remember group by. What were we doing in group by? In a particular department, what is their average salary? Take out that. Who work in that department? Take out that. What is their average salary in that department? Take out that. So in that case, what were you doing department wise? You were doing clustering. You were making groups. So in those cases, it works. Now I want all the corresponding information of one. So in that case, I will go to one department. So I want all the corresponding information of the department. I want all the corresponding information of the department. I want all the information of employees. So I can remove it. See here two is written. Now where is two shown to me first? It is shown in block one. So here too block one is written. Okay. If there is a value of two, then I will get it. Where is three? Three is also shown in block one. Now see here what will happen. When you will go to search three, then where will I see in block one? So I can put a binary search here. Okay. Why can I put it? Because I am saying that everything is sorted. So I will put a binary search in block one. By putting binary search, I will get three. And I know that the corresponding values of three, which are the next values, because it is repeating, duplicates, I will get them in the next status. So I will find this. I will find this. I will get three. Here network has been named like this. Here I have four or four varying distribution. Okay. I will put four three three in it. So that is the, crackers are the last three that I need to do it, look at this table here. It can be made, wouldn't it be a trickery, did the player show up in the right place? Alright. Nothing but four with seven. Also, in B2 with seven, if B2 comes in B2, then it will not be in B2, now it will come with 74 in B2, then only in the corresponding is square. Tip 3. Okay. The process is same. I am doing clustering in this, so I call it clustering indexing by some people, some writers, but I will say that this is primary indexing. Why is it primary indexing? Because the criteria of primary indexing is that a file should be sorted on the basis of any search key. Only the primary indexing has one motto or one condition, what is that condition? That is, the data file must be sorted on any search key, that's it, nothing else, OK, but some writers call this clustering indexing separately. I will say that it is part of primary indexing, if you sort on the basis of that key, then your indexing becomes sparse, If you make a sort on the basis of this, then your indexing becomes dense type, OK, how to make dense type indexing? Let's understand this, I say that when you indexed the sorted file on the basis of the non-key, Clustering indexing is when you index a protected file on the basis of a non-key, index, then in that case dense indexing is made, why? because what I am doing? every unique value, every unique value I am indexing ok, I know this value is repeating ok, but every unique value which is the value of every search key particular value, I am putting it in index and what we said in dense indexing, what is dense indexing? it contains index record for each search key value in the data file so in this each search key value means what is the value of unique search key? 1, 2, 3, 4 so 1, 2, 3, 4 are all in your index table so in this case I call it dense indexing that this is a dense indexing ok, so look carefully what we have made in notes what is in notes? primary indexing which I call clustering indexing in that case this is a part, this is not a part I will say this is a scheme dense and sparse indexing is just a type of an idea ok, how that idea is used? when you sort on the basis of key so here I call it a sparse index because here I can store the zero of block because it is on the basis of key so everything is unique I am doing it on the basis of non-key because it can be repeated on the basis of non-key here clustering can be done, clusters are made so in that case what I do? I call it dense indexing because I am storing every value 1 is also stored here, 2 is also stored here, 3 is also stored here, 4 is also stored here and what was happening here? this, this is the sorted on the basis of key attribute I was not keeping 1, 2, 3, 4 everything I was keeping 1 then I kept 11 straight 11 is kept straight 21 ok, because I knew I was sure that this is a candidate key and it will not be repeated this is a key attribute, it will not be repeated, it is unique so in this case I can use sparse but in this case I have to use dense because I don't know that this is not a unique value I don't have any confidence in this block so I have to keep all the entries, I have to keep 1 but I am so sure that I keep the first occurrence of 1 here I keep 1 first, I keep that block I find the first 1 in that block and then I will get all the 1s ok, so this is your clustering indexing you must have understood what I am trying to say so this is your primary indexing type which is based on non key attribute now where is the need for this? its need is at that place where you have to group on the basis of non key like we have taken an example department wise ok, you have to group in course wise that in this course which are all the enrolled students in this case I have to do this type of indexing ok, very good now in this we will see that in this case and in this case what is the number of entries sparse index means the number of entries we are doing in the base of key in that base what is the number of entries in index table in index file total number of block is the number of entries ok, this is your example ok, here how many blocks were there? 1000 blocks were there so here also how many entries were there? 1000 entries were there ok, so using 1000 entries I was able to access data file of 10000 but what will happen here? here I don't have any trust things are getting repeated so I have to store every single value 1, 2, 3 now I don't even know how many times a value can be repeated 1 can be repeated many times 1 can be repeated only once 2 can be repeated many times 3 can be repeated only once 4 can be repeated many times so that's why here is dense indexing so here how many entries are there in index table? this is the number of entries in index table equal to 1 and this is the unique known key attribute value in the data file ok, now we understand the unique value is I am not doing indexing again and again in 1's corresponding what am I doing? I am keeping the first 1 as a representative and indexing it that's it ok so now you must have understood what is this primary indexing clustering indexing is primary indexing ok and some others this type and this type we call it clustering index ok, no problem now let's move forward one is multi-level indexing ok, what is the meaning of multi-level indexing? now look carefully that here things were sorted ok multi-level is also an example of primary indexing what was the criteria of primary indexing? this file must be sorted on the basis of any one key attribute on the basis of any one search key attribute ok so this is sorted now because this file is sorted you have done indexing now it may be that the file is very big it may be a very big file it may be a population of India so you will do one type of sorting I mean sorry you will do one type of indexing then after that when you again do further indexing on that indexing what I call this thing multi-level indexing ok look here this is some example two-level sparse indexing this is your actual data block data block 2 data block 3 there are data blocks like this here you have done this type of indexing in indexing data block this data block is stored like this so you have done further one more outer indexing that indexing is on which that indexing is on the basis of inner index means that index which you have made further indexing on that is multi-level indexing ok further indexing is multi-level indexing so let's understand one example of multi-level indexing ok here I have told you one concept let's see one simple example this is some such example same roll number student this is your data file ok what is in this data file 100 101 102 103 like this now you have one let's forget this this you out from the picture this is out from the picture for now so you think that we have done this indexing so we have done this first indexing we have written 100 we have written 100 we have stored pointer corresponding to 100 from 100 from 100 to 109 so many values you have indexed on this basis that if there is 101 sorry there is 100 so I have pointed it here now from 100 to 109 I will find means I have to find 109 so what I will do I will see 100 and then I will go to that memory block I will go to that data block and after going to the data block I will take 109 by taking the binance search I will take out 109 ok second what I have done here 110 120 ok if there is confusion then understand this thing here I wrote here 1 then I wrote 11 then I wrote 11 right so something like this simple same example same example done here ok something like this now further if I do indexing further what I did now I did grouping of them from 100 to 200 from 100 to 200 not from 100 from 100 to 200 before till here I have stored its pointer from here I have stored 200 from here I have stored 300 from here ok so now if I want value of 109 then I will start from here so I will go from here 100 I will reach this data block now this data block will give me data block of actual memory and here I will remove that value I will retrieve it ok similar example I want 209 I want 209 so I will go to outer indexing which is the one which I have put on the index I will go to that here I will see 200 where is the information of 200 I have information here so this data block this 200 corresponding to 200 to 300 from here to 300 from 300 to before it is storing information I will see 209 here 209 will be in this so I will reach here with this BP I will get information of 209 in this block so from here I will retrieve information of 209 ok so this way multi level indexing works means ok this is more means basically when your one index is not working and data is too much then you do multi level indexing and see carefully that this is why we are storing this thing on hard disk why are you doing this because this data file was on hard disk you basically why did you need multi level indexing because your index table which was the first index table first level index table was getting bigger now because it was so big so we picked it up and stored it on hard disk because its size was big so you made a small index table in your RAM ok so we do something like this in multi level indexing very good ok so now we will understand next next we will understand secondary indexing ok if I am a big man then there are only two types of indexing primary indexing and secondary indexing in primary indexing there are two types of schemas schemas means there are two types of types I will not say types there are two types of ideas sparse or dense ok and what you do based on primary based on non primary sorting so if if you do this sort then in different ways we have understood it if it is based on primary attribute then what will happen we do sparse indexing if it is based on non primary attribute then in it because it can be repeated then in it what do we do we have to do dense indexing ok now let's understand about secondary indexing secondary indexing is applied on those files those data files are applied on which are unsorted which are unsorted now this this this for example if this is unsorted then it goes on and this also goes on now if is okay if it goes on then it goes on on un sorted files ok so the If the data file is sorted according to your primary, then it will be sorted according to age, name, address. If any file is sorted on the basis of one key, then it is highly possible that it will be unsorted on the basis of all the attributes. If you want to do indexing on the basis of unsorted, then you have to do secondary indexing. This is mostly required because in this case, a primary indexing has already been applied on this data file. Now I have to sort on a secondary key. In that case, secondary indexing helps me. What will happen in this case? In this case, I have to sort on a secondary key. The attribute that is your search key can be your key and non-key. Key means that there is no primary key here, it can also be a candidate's key. So it can be both key and non-key, it doesn't matter to us. Reason being, because it is unsorted, if I will take the address of the first block corresponding to 1, I will also get the address of the first block, then I will not get the surety of this part that after 1, I will get 2. After 1, I will get 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, basically it is not sorted, so I can't put binary search. In this block, I will get 1, 2, 3, I can't say this. I don't know where 3 will be or where 2 will be, they must be lying in different places. So in this case, I have to store the base pointer of every search key from 1 to 100. Okay. If I have to do this, then what do I say to it? This is also a dense indexing. Because I have to store all the information of the search key here. Okay. I have to store all the information of the search key here. Okay. So very good. Now let's understand this thing again, if anyone is confused. Suppose it is 2, I have to store the corresponding 2 here. Now see carefully, 2 is not on its base address. 2 is lying anywhere. Because it is random, it is unsorted, so I have to put linear search here. I can't do binary search work. If there are things sorted, then I will be able to find that after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 will come. Because I locate 1, then if there are 10 items in that block, then I will get everything from 1 to 10. Okay. I can say this when it is sorted. Now because it is unsorted, I don't know where 10 is, where 9 is, I don't know. So I will have to make all the corresponding entries of the search key in the index table. That's why it is an example of dense indexing. Okay. Very good. Now the second thing is also this. Now I will say how many number of entries will be in it. Because it is dense indexing. So the number of entries will be equal to the unique value of the search key. Okay. It will be equal to the unique value of the search key. Because it is dense indexing. Okay. Now think carefully that I have written everything unique here. Now it may be that the search key is not unique. The search key is not unique. Okay. Let's take an example of this. Suppose I make it quickly here. Now see this example. Here I said that everything was unique. Here I said that everything is not unique. Okay. Because it is unsorted. Okay. Because it is unsorted. So here there is 1, here too, here too there is 2, here too there is 2. Okay. Suppose your 1 was also here. Okay. So you see here, suppose I call this b1, I call this b2, this b3, this b4, this b5. Okay. So if I say that this b1 is here, then I will call this b2. Okay. Suppose I say b19. Okay. So if this is the case, then how will I do indexing now? Now how will I store in the index table? Okay. So what is the method to store it? That I can make a link list here. Or I can make a further index table here. How? That what I do? 1. I have to store 1. Now where is 1 lying? 1 is also lying in b1. 1 is also lying in b19. Okay. Similarly, if I have to store 2, because I have to make all the entries here. I have to store 1. So I have to store b1. Now I have to store 1. Now I have to store b2. Now I have to store b3. Now I have to store b4. Now I have to store b5. Because I have to make all the entries here. I have to make all the entries here. Because it is unsorted. So I have to make all the entries here because I cannot search binary. Okay? Only when I had to do binary search like this case where I could have searched binary or because here the data was sorted I would just store 1. I would have known that I will get up to 2,3,4,5,6,10 in this block. But here I don't know. Here I don't know. 1 is also lying here. Sorry. Sorry. 1 here is also lying here. So here b2. 1 2 3. There is also this b2. There is also b2. So there is also b2. So here b2. There is also b2 b2. I will get the index in this block only. But I don't know here. I don't know here. 1 is here also. Sorry. Sorry. 1 is here also. Next was also there. 1. And 1 was here also. So I don't know here. So in that case I have to store all the information. I have to create all the index corresponding to search key. So I will create 2 on the base of 2. So where is 2? It is in B2. And 2 is in B19. So I have to make this own like this. So in this case, the entries in the index table are linked. I have stored B1 and B19. So how will it be when searching? 1 will search B1 and pick up these 2 entries. And B19 will search and pick up this entry. So this is how your work is done in secondary indexing. Now someone may ask a question. Tell me one thing, why is secondary indexing useful? Because this thing is unsolved. This is all unsolved. Now because it is unsolved, what is the benefit of my indexing? What is the benefit? I will tell you what is the benefit. Suppose there was no indexing. So in this case, because it is unsolved, what would you have to do? You could not put binary search. What would you have to do? You would have to put linear search. So if there was a 1 lakh record in it, then you would have to iterate on 1 lakh record. Now what benefit did you take from your indexing here? Here you took the benefit that now on indexing, because it is sorted, you look carefully, index table is sorted. Now you can put binary search on it. What will you do? Suppose you have to find some 89th entry, then when you would have taken it directly from the file, then you would have done linear search. Now what will you do here? Because the index table is made, the index table is made in extra space. And this thing has a sorted entry. So you could have found 89th through binary search. So this is the benefit. This interview can be a question that in secondary indexing, things are unsorted. So what is the benefit of indexing? So you will say that the benefit of indexing is that dense indexing is there. You put all the entries of the things that are unsorted, that is, the unsorted of the search, you put the corresponding entry of every search in the index table. And those sorted entries are put. So you can put binary search on sorted entries. And corresponding block entries. And corresponding block points. So this is the benefit of secondary indexing. So that was all in this lecture. Very good. One more thing that secondary indexing is also called non-clustering index. And the number of entries is equal to the number of records in the data file. And if things are repeating, then the number of entries will be like dense. The number of entries will be equal to the number of records in the data file. This is also called unique data file entries. That is, how many entries will be in the number here? Unique. Here there is one. So one entry is one. But the corresponding entry of one is the entry of BP. That is a link list. OK? Very good. So this was all about indexing. I hope you understood this. It's a little confusing. If you watch the video again and again, you will understand. But indexing is a very important topic in computer science. You should know a very important concept. If you come to the computer world. in the world of computer. See you in the next lecture. Good bye."}

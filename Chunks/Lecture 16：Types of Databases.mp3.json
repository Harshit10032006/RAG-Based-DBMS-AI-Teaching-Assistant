    "text": " Hello, how are you? This is Lakshya. So, today we are going to learn about DBMS lecture no. 16. And today we are going to learn about types of databases. So, let's understand types of databases. We have already studied some types of databases. We have been discussing relational model from the beginning. We have also discussed the model of NoSQL in the last lecture. So, let's see the formula of the databases. What are their use cases? So, the first database that we have studied is relational database. So, we have already studied about relational databases. This relational model is used in it. We define things in the form of tables. Tables are related to each other. And I also call tables as relations. I establish relations through the form of a form. So, all the tables are related to each other. So, we have also studied about relational integrity and constraints. We have studied these well. We have discussed about the nodes briefly. Based on relational model. And this database management system is very popular and also used in today's use cases. It is also very mature in its use cases. In almost all types of cases, this is used in the use cases. Apart from the use case that we discussed in the last lecture. I have discussed in the last lecture where I need scalability, horizontal scalability If there is no horizontal scalability in the system, then I can use relational model, MySQL, RDBMS So I will say that this is the most matured, although nowadays in the perspective of cloud NoSQL is almost mature If I talk about MongoDB, then it is also very matured and very old So its community support is very good You will get its courses on the stack overflow and internet all over the world You will get its support if you are stuck somewhere, then you will get its support easily There will be no issue Things are stored in the form of discrete tables I will establish a relation with the help of join It is meaningful data I will remove it I will remove it from RDBMS And it is highly optimized Because it stores structured data I am inputting data in relational model or RDBMS So my data should be structured In the last lecture, we discussed about structured and unstructured data And it guarantees that the data will be normalized Its requirement is that you will do normalization You will remove the redundancy So you will put the data That's why we have studied the whole design of relational model Before that, we will visualize the data We will make the diagram We will convert it into tables How data normalization is applied slowly And things are almost normalized And data redundancy is not there We retrieve it with SQL Use system becomes more complex If the data is more large, then the system becomes more complex Because you will have many tables Establish the relation in many tables Okay And if the data is not large Then the system becomes massive So it becomes problematic for DBA If your relational model is too large For a particular application For software Then it is difficult to manage it The biggest disadvantage of DBA is Scalability issue I will call it mature DB But it has only one problem It is horizontal scalability It was mentioned in the last lecture If someone asks you in the interview What is the problem in relational model It is not used in the cloud system Or why I don't call it the best DBMS In relational model Or relational databases Because in today's date The capability to fulfill the requirements of the cloud Is not that good Right This video is sponsored by Cryo Cryo is a world leading work experience based learning platform Where you can enhance your software skills And also grab top dev jobs Unlike usual courses In Cryo you will learn full stack development Or backend development But by building industry level projects In a real developer environment At the end of their programs You will have made a lot of projects Which will make your resume more effective And will also become a strong github profile You will be able to see

link Grab a placement And you will give me a party So book your free trial now Let's move ahead Object oriented databases If I talk about object oriented databases Let's discuss this formally Object oriented data modeling Now we are getting to know about object oriented Oops Does anyone remember oops from object oriented Oops Object oriented programming Right I will say that this works on similar concepts of oops Okay In oops you must have seen objects Objects Classes One instance of class is object Right And we Encapsulation Inheritance And morphism Right We establish these types of things In our oops Right So you have a class There are instance of class Which I call objects Okay If you are a little confused So I would recommend that The love bubble You will get a playlist of oops You will get it on YouTube If you read oops Then you will understand Basically what are class objects Because oops Oops DB Or I say To understand object oriented DB You have to have a little knowledge What are the concepts of oops Right That's why I will say This is a little typical to understand And it is not very popular Because it is very advanced You need to understand this thing to understand capabilities Right To model You will think everything in an object oriented way You will design your whole system in an object oriented way Right So Okay I move ahead Assuming that you have information about class object You have a little knowledge of oops What is encapsulation polymorphism What is inheritance What is relationship between the two What is the relationship between the two You know what it is I assume Let's move ahead What do you have in the class Attributes Right Class attributes and methods I will say it with functions Right Attributes are methods What do attributes tell I will say There are characteristics What are the characteristics What are the data types Define the class Right What do the methods tell Behavior This behavior word is very important If someone asks you in the class What are the functions of the class What are the methods What do they tell They tell you The behavior of the object What will he do What is the object capable of doing The work of telling that thing His methods do So The behavior of the class Is defined by The methods defined in that particular class Right Let's move ahead Now I will say We understood this In object oriented DB Everything is Everything Everything Everything Everything Everything Everything Everything Everything All these Would label The base of the object Because First thing Then Everything \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1!! \u00a1\u00a1 reference catalogue Objects have tables, executable code, etc. All objects communicate via methods Another characteristic of this is that handles are the ID of the object Or I call it as primary If you are working in relational terms Very good All information stored in DB is capable of being represented as an object That means whatever data is stored If I retrieve it It is retrieved in the form of a data It is simply called an object I can call it an object Before understanding the example Let's see what is written in the notes Object oriented data model is purely based on Object oriented programming paradigm Object oriented paradigm We will see the whole DB In which things can be class What classes can I define May be I make a class for students Entity is related to the ER diagram I make an entity I make a class for class I will define some method in the class What are the attributes of the class What can the class do What is its behavior And I will store the data in the form of the class I made a student class I wrote the name, role number, etc. And what can the student do Student can study I made a method like this Or student Did the student pass I made a method of this Did he pass the 2021 exam So what will you do You will make the object instance Whenever your data will come By making the object instance Student's name, role number You will set everything And in DB You will store it in the form of the object When you will retrieve You will retrieve it in the form of the object And there are methods in every object So student.ispassed If you call it, you will know If it was passed or not It has an executable code in it too If you read in depth It would be an entire course But try to understand Those who will understand What is the meaning of storing in the form of the object There are no tables There are no tables I made a table I made a blueprint I am storing it row by row You have a class You will make an instance of the class You will make an object And store the object All concepts of OOPS are applied in it How inheritance is applied To apply inheritance You can say There is a person class There is a name, gender And age stored Now the person class is inherited by the student And the professor is inherited by the same The student has a different attribute Sorry The professor has a different attribute So this way you define Here inheritance is applied And the object has an identity The object is a represented object The student is a represented object The student is a represented object The student is a represented object In encapsulation I can hide the information Of the student And vice versa Very good With methods to provide an interface to the object Let's move forward Object is structured And collection of data This also stores structured data You can understand The structure of the object If I am doing in the form of an object I need some structure If the name of the student Then I will store it Let's move forward Sometimes the database can be very complex Having multiple relations Maintain relations between them can be tedious at times In object oriented database What was this I am trying to tell In which position I use When it becomes very complex It is difficult to establish relations In relational model problems come The basis of the model is relations Relation of one table to another If it is tedious task To maintain it Then we can shift to object oriented database In object oriented database Data is treated as object We understood All the information comes in one instantly available Object package Instead of multiple tables I need information What will I do I will not bring information All the information will be stored in my object Let's see the advantages and disadvantages But before that let's see an example If I see an example Suppose you have a person object Right It will be the name We used to make some such class diagrams Remember Phone number Email address And the name of the person And the name of the person And the name of the person So there are some such examples We have tried to take a small example Like a person class In person class This is the blueprint So person objects will be stored And another object is student Student has number, mask and relevant information So student is a person Student is a person So I can say Student is a type of person Professor is also a type of person So here inheritance is there These are the attributes And annex F And here many likes Talking about block What comes from this after So your teacher has by right He is not classified So it depends There is some reason Which suits Bachelor It checks the past data and if it passed in 2021 or 2010 It can give information about the failed subjects The student can get information related to his subject I can model the information that the student's professor should know Or the information related to the student The university knows about it but the professor doesn't know about it So I can hide it The person must be living somewhere The address is stored separately by making an object I call a method called lives at method That method tells me the address So methods are stored separately I am interacting with other objects through this method This is the object oriented model Let's see the advantages of this method The advantage is that data storage is easy and quick Because data comes in the form of object All bits of information comes instantly So I don't have to bring information by joining So some things are like a skill Can handle complex data relations More variety of data types than relational databases How can it handle complex data relations Because it doesn't have the relationship That everything should be individually tabled There should be no redundancy Your normalization should be very strong There is no particular method here There is no particular norm here Model is relatively friendly in the real world So basically you see that object oriented programming Why did it come in the picture It is easier to solve real world problems It is easier to model your software Suppose your software is written on object oriented base And your DB is also written on object oriented base So it is easy to interact with both Because both are written in the same paradigm Right Works with the functionality of OOPs and object oriented languages That is, you have written something in C++ in object oriented case And you have written it in Java And you want to use your particular object oriented DB So its interaction will be easy Both are written with the same mindset What is the direct advantage of this High complexity causes performance issues Like we write Sometimes this also becomes very complex Now the address is stored separately You are calling again and again So performance issues increase in it You are calling again and again You have written the information You are calling the method Comme dans une list Like what are their sometimes Software like I am not giving actual info You can check this All run on revealed To the \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdkus Views can't be supported here but you can implement views using encapsulation So, what is your example? ObjectDB and GemStorm This is its example Third, let's go to NoSQL databases I won't talk much about it In the last video, we have studied about NoSQL DB Let's review it quickly Non-tabular databases Storage of data is stored in the form of other than the relational tables It is schema free There are no tables It can handle huge data There is redundancy and repeated data You can read and understand in lecture 15 Let's understand hierarchical databases You store information in hierarchical databases You must be able to understand Let me tell you a prime example of this Family tree What happens in family tree? First of all, you have grandparents Then you have parents Then you have individuals Then you have further individuals It is made of hierarchical databases First of all, there is root Then there is hierarchy So, you have to store information in this way Then you use hierarchical databases The biggest use case is that you want information from top to bottom You want to bring information by traversing like this When there is such a requirement in this case Then you use it Let me tell you one more example of this File system What happens in file system? If I talk about Linux system There is root directory I call it like this After root, you have further home Then you have further users Like this Temp In home, you have made a directory Movies It will be like this Movies Music Okay You have made further directories like this So, in this scene, one thing is noted The parent is the same There is one parent and further child is there So, there is parent-child relation here Okay You know that there will be a parent above and then there will be a child Then there will be a parent and then there will be a child So, when you have to store information in this way Then you can use hierarchical database File system can be an example of this Okay Let's understand this In this Your most appropriate for use In which the main focus of information gathering is based on the concrete hierarchy That is, to gather information, I need information from above I give you an example of this Example is In your organization, management Okay How is hierarchy of management in organization? First of all, CEO Then VP Okay Then your presidents First, there are presidents There are vice presidents There is CTO Then there is a senior director There is director There are managers There is marketing director By doing this Departments are made Here are departments I will tell you about the department Above all, your company is Then there is a marketing department Okay Then there is your HR department Then there is your CA department There is some department Further you have divided the department So, in this way you have to store information Suppose you are in the organization All the departments are stored information Who reports to whom Who reports to whom Which department comes under which department So, when I have to store this type of information Then I use the hierarchy database Okay If I have to gather information in the way of concrete hierarchy Then I need this Such as several individual employees reporting to single department at a company Okay Suppose you have a department You have a software engineer department Many employees are working in it Then there are more employees in one employee There are more leads in one lead By doing this information is stored When I have to store information like this Then I use the hierarchy database Okay When I know that I have this type of data Then I will not use the no SQL database or your relational data model unnecessarily Okay In relational data model, from one multiple M is to N's relational is established Otherwise its use case is different So, I will not increase the complexity unnecessarily I know that I have to retrieve the data like this So, I will use the direct use case of the hierarchy database Because it is simple It is sitting in my use case The schema for the hierarchy database is defined By its tree like organization Right Inverted tree There is tree like organization in it In which there is typically root parent There is a parent Directory of the data stored as record That links to various sub directories Okay Consider file system Information with sub directories And each sub directory branch to the child record May link to various other sub directory branches So, to store this type of data If your requirement is like this Then you will use Suppose I give you one more example You have You open the next shop Of electronics So, in it you have made a table of electronics Okay, all the electronics Now in this electronics You have made another table Table stored in any way What you have kept Phones Okay Then you have kept here Tv's Then you have kept here Washing machine Then in phones you have kept Suppose all the Apple phones Okay Samsung phones Okay Okay Like this further Tv you have kept Consider LCD TV LED TV You have opened this shop Okay So, you can store such information Okay And here in the washing machine You have kept automatic Semi-automatic In this way So, information you have to store like this So, you can do this You have Electrical You have Consider any business opened Or you have opened an electronics shop Right Now suppose you want How many types of tv you have You have to list all the tvs So, what will you do You will traverse here From here you will go to tv You will go to tv You will print all the notes of LCD You will go here You will print all the notes of LED So, when I have to retrieve data like this To retrieve data from above to below So, I use this type of database Okay Since the disk storage system is Also inherently a dark structure These models can be used in physical model Now remember what we had studied We had studied That I have a Conceptual schema There is a physical schema Right Right Conceptual and physical And there is a view schema So, the conceptual schema Is a logical schema Right How to tell which data is related What is the data And the physical schema tells How will I store this disk Now with this A very big advantage is That because Your logical schema is also Tree like structure And your file system is also Tree like structure Okay So, the way you have made your logical schema So, you can store it In this way So, you can store it In this way So, you can store it In this way So, you can store it In the way you have made your logical schema In this way You can copy paste the same schema In the disk In the same way You can copy paste the same schema And you can derive it And you can store it In the same way So, that is why He is saying That in the physical model You can store it in this way In the way of the physical model It can also be used Since the disk Storage system Is also inherently A hierarchy structure These models can be used For Physical model Right We understood this Now, what is its advantage What is the key advantage of this This is a The advantage of this This is a The advantage of this This is easy to use You can buy your Electronics shop So, you can use it You can also use it Right I can see a simple structure I can see a simple structure One to many organization One to many organization Of the data makes traversal Of the data makes traversal Simple and fast Which is the ideal use case Such as website Drop down menus And computer folder system Right And we have seen one example Which is electronic system Which is electronic system Due to separation of Table from physical storage structure Information can be easily used Or deleted Without The entirety Of the Structure Or the Of the database How It is like It is like Your What was it Electronics TV Phones So, suppose You want I am not selling TV I am not selling TV So, you will drop This node of TV database So, when you Drop this So, when you Drop this So, this will be the root All the childs of this Will be deleted automatically So, your database Will be free easily So, it is easy to manage So, it is easy to manage Most major programming Language offer functionality For reading tree like structure So, means Trees are very important You have read in DSM So, most programming Support also Now, what is its major disadvantage That it is inflexible In nature This is one to many structure But suppose Which is siblings There is a relation in siblings If there is a relation in siblings Then how will you establish it Right This is Saying That one to many Should be At the same level You can not establish Relations between each other So, if you have such a use case Then you Do not use it So, you can use it In this way Then you will not be able to use it Right So, there is this type of problem In it Right So, it is written here The one to many structure Is not ideal for complex structure As it cannot describe Relationship In which Each child node Has multiple parent nodes One child node Has multiple parent nodes Something like this Can happen In your use case Also The tree like structure Of organization of data Requires bottom to Top to bottom Sequential search This is time consuming Right Now suppose You have a very big tree structure Your So, you Because you have to start From the top From the root Always start searching You traverse from the root So, when It will be very big Very much data So, it Maintain Or In it Traversal It will be very costly In terms of time complexity Right So, in that case It is useless To use Its example is IBM IMS Right IBM IMS It Is a very good example And What is the form of IBM IMS Information management system Of IBM IMS Now As we have seen Its dissonance That one node It cannot have multiple parents Now Where this use case You have That one node Should have multiple parents So, in that case We use network database This is the fifth type Of database In it There is a simple extension That is Related Like hierarchical Hierarchy is made In it Right Some tree like structure But Multiple parents Can be Now where multiple parents Can be Right A graph like structure So, its organization Is of graph structure The child records Are given The freedom To associate With multiple parent Records Child node Has freedom In multiple parent Record As type Multiple parents Can be Related In it Complex relation Can be handled As here Complex relation Can't be handled Right If multiple parents Can be Stored Because hierarchical database Can be Mstuen links So, now because Mstuen links So, it will be More slow Tree was slow When there was a lot of data So, tree like structure Your hierarchical database Was slow We saw it In it When there will be A lot of data So, there is a lot of data Along with Mstuen links So, traversal Will be Very costly Traversal of graph Is costly Right Same problem Will come here Its web community support Is not good Not much There are many specific use case Of hierarchical database And network database There are many specific use case Even object oriented database Has many specific use case Right It is not used much Means More community support Whose community support is not much So, not much use Has happened In past And will not be used further Most Famous Databases Are these Your relational database And no SQL databases Right No SQL database Modern databases Right And relational database Has been running for a long time It is old But very mature Databases Right Let's continue Its example is Integrated Data store IDS And IDMS Integrated Data Database management system This is old Old example Turbo image Not much used In today's date Very old Legacy system Used Now Let's see One example of Network database Right So, this is Your Network DB Let's see One example What is in it Departments Right You have Admin So, this Will be related Like this Department What do you have Here Student Faculty And Sports Suppose And suppose Here There are Clubs Right Student And Faculty Can be in some clubs Right So, here You have Clubs Right Student Faculty Can be in some clubs Can be in some clubs Sports Can be established in some clubs So, this type Here Multiple Your parents Student's parents Which is Department And clubs Right Faculty's parents Department And clubs So, this type Structure You have to make You have to have Multiple parents Multiple Parents Relations So, in that case Use network DB Right And You Pay attention To the Right So, briefly You You should Right Right Right Right Right Right Right Right Right Right Right Right Okay So what I Really So Right Okay Okay You I Today Keep Open Open Or Don't Stop Hit Your contract Please Please To Very Lite One Scale esempioissant graph like structure so very good if i say again you have to pay attention to this and this you must have information about other things may be you are asked in interview what is relational database and what is noSQL apart from that which database you think you want to give hint or interviewer ask you question so you should have some idea very good so we will end this lecture here i hope you have got idea about different type of databases and when and which is used which you have to use which is more popular whose developer support you will not get whose community support you will not get you make your own software so whose you will use now what is your work your work is this think in mind suppose you are making software institute management system or you are making google maps or any software and which database you will use out of these five ok tell this in comment section tell in comment section which is your favourite database which you like more and in your use case whatever you have thought in your mind in that which database you will use will you use relational database or noSQL database or will you use any other database whose developer support is less very good we will end this lecture here see you in next lecture till then good bye"

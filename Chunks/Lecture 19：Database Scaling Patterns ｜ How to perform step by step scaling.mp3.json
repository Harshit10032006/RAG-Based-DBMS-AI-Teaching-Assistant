guys, this is Lakshya and today we are going to learn about DBMS lecture 19 and today we are going to start our DBMS which is placement specific DBMS phase 3 we have discussed in starting introduction video that first of all we will discuss some basics that will be the first phase, in second phase we will discuss important topics in important topics we have discussed about indexing, SQL, NoSQL, Sharding, write and clustering, partitioning, we have discussed about many things now I hope you have understood some important and basic topics now we will move to interview specific questions interview specific were already questions, in previous topics we can directly make interview specific questions but in interview specific design topics we will discuss how you scale database how you are making your system how you are making your system how you are managing many data if you are applying scaling and increasing number of requests then what techniques we will apply and when and which technique we will apply this is very important to know till now we have discussed about SQL and NoSQL you will remember this, in 1 hour video of NoSQL I have discussed about what is NoSQL and when is the use of NoSQL database this can be a design specific interview question so we have discussed about this in NoSQL video so I am just telling you the question that you can ask this question that what is the difference between NoSQL and SQL and when and which one we have to use very good we have discussed about relational and non-relational databases we have discussed about SQL and NoSQL types we have discussed this now we will discuss some more interesting topics in this design topics in phase 3 we will discuss some better topic a very nice topic which I personally like very much we will discuss that so in last 2 lectures we have studied some things that if database increases if huge data is created if issue of manageability is created then we will scale it if number of requests increases then we will scale it recently in last 10 years many startups have come to you like flipkart after that flipkart became a big company ola many companies like this have come paytm if you see in starting there were very small apps means they have very small database data will be very less because users are less if user base is less then database is small if database is small then there are less issues of manageability but slowly as they have scaled user base increased if I talk about you number of requests also increased right users will increase number of requests will increase concrete users will increase right so how they have applied scaling so if you are asked questions or if you are asked that which scaling patterns or scalability patterns are used when you are scaling database and when you are scaling database when user base increases then data increases when data increases then number of requests also increases more users concurrently will try to work on that database so we will discuss in step by step manner in step by step manner that when your startup is made when startup is made then how many requests are there in starting when it is small then how is its database what are the scaling options are supplied and second if your user base is increasing you want to scale then at which point which scaling option is feasible for you right we will discuss this it will be very interesting video you will know a lot of things you will know some industry specific things you are sitting in college I know you are sitting in college then you will know some book specific bookish things right but here we will also learn some industry specific things it will be a very good video you have to study it carefully thanks to them what is coding ninjas it is one of the largest coding education platform where you can give many types of courses if you are interested in paid courses if you want to do development do machine learning do android do web development do system design do course subject OS DBMS do DSA do java do python in any language then you can take those paid courses the most beautiful thing that people praise coding ninjas is that here one on one doubt resolving support is available if you have any doubt then it will be resolved in one to two hours courses are made in a very well structured way that if you put hard work then you will definitely get the result course makers already big companies have been broken so you don't need to worry about it if you talk about language Hindi English both are available while solving the question you will get a hint video so if you want to buy any paid course then you can buy it from the link in the description you can click on it and you can get 20% discount which is the maximum you will get thank you so we are going to discuss in design topic about database scaling patterns ok we are going to discuss something like this so in this discussion I have made notes in the form of slides because we will go step by step ok so you can see that I have made notes in the form of slides so you can see that I have made notes in the form of slides now I am going to talk about the topic which I have made in the form of slides so each step is a slide ok so let's shift to the slide we are going to study database scaling pattern how we will do step by step scaling right first of all we will see what we want to know we want to know in step by step manner when to choose this scaling option ok why we are doing scaling because data is increasing user base is increasing you want to scale why you want to scale so that your performance increases your database is available ok your API latency is reduced there is a lag ok users the concrete users which have increased the request which have increased they will be served quickly and user experience will be good ok performance will be good ok we have studied all this in last 1-2 topics we were doing all this in clustering we were doing all this in partitioning we were doing all this in sharding we were doing all this so basically we were making a distributed database ok we will do something like this going forward you will understand if you read then also this lecture ok so you will understand more moving forward this scaling option is visible practically at the moment means if my database has x size or x number of request comes on my database then which scaling option will be better because see you opened a small startup ok you opened a small startup now in starting its database because it is small database right so its database in starting initial in first level you can't make such a database design like amazon's database ok like uber ola's database like this you can't make distributed design of your database multiple servers multiple data centers in different continents you can't make why can't you make first thing there is no requirement we know that necessity is the mother of all inventions now there is no requirement then why you will do why you will make database complicated ok because you don't have that many requests you don't want to do anything ok and if you say no I want to do then cost will be a big matter for you your revenue is not much now on your app users are not on board you mostly data mostly your money you are spending on marketing and running campaigns but at that point of time you can't make your database so big who knows your idea will fail market will like it or your idea will be unfavorable for current point of time so you can't do it so in starting you will keep it small as requirement will increase then only you will scale in starting you won't do such expensive system of database ok so this is practical thing ok let's move ahead you want to do scaling yes we were doing something like this ok who have seen last 2-3 videos must have remembered let's move ahead so there is a case study ok we are going to make an app of capping booking ok you can give any name so in starting you have a tiny startup nothing you have started in your neighborhood ok you have few drivers you have few customers also very less you have 10 customers on board some of them are your friends ok some of them you asked your friends on referral basis to try it ok you have done on board now because user base is very small ok and trips are also less in 5 minutes you can book one trip you have made your infra in 5 minutes you can book one trip in 5 minutes what will be visible in that how will be your app you can put it that everyone has run Ola Uber it will be same type of app what information will be stored in it your small system small machine you had an old machine in that you set it on database server ok in that you are storing information of customers information of trips information of locations you are storing booking data you are storing history of trip you are storing all these things ok everyone has run Ola Uber you have not run Ola Uber you can see now our work is database management system ok in DBMS understand DB how your system will grow now we are not going to the features in this app we are not going to requirement analysis ok very well we have understood that we are going to work on database of cab booking because you have made a new app ok and now its scale is this much so now your app is running well ok you don't have any problem because in your area that app is very famous ok people have started to refer you after referring what happened your 10 booking 10 booking per minute started to come suppose 10 booking per minute now what are you seeing that users are saying that your app is running very sluggish it is running very slow some latency is coming some write update in late driver shows in late ok some write so application hangs this type of shows are coming so your slow app is running you have investigated you came to know that api latency is the problem what is api latency you had a small machine as we discussed and it was capable if one trip is in 5 minutes then it can handle this much now what happened 10 booking started to come that too in 1 minute now because 10 booking started to come in 1 minute so many requests come concurrently and because when requests come when requests hit here then your system which is small it can't handle it it can't handle it it can't process it so whatever let's say here an x request came so its response time is very much increased because response time is very much so your app is running slow I don't know if you remember or not in starting foodpanda app came when in starting any new apps came which was on small scale indian indian startup so it was running very slow indian startup which was started their starting was like this trading was ready anything was happening you write it disappeared ok or you have entered in database means you have entered write request you entered your username or changed anything or order history you can't see that after 1 hour you can see that ok why after 1 hour you can see we will discuss about this write request is gone but read request that thing didn't come ok this type of things means sluggish app was running in starting means all these new startups you can see same case with you same issue is coming now we have discussed that your app is famous problem started request increased ok your database was tiny so performance was slow why performance is slow ipv latency increased transaction facing dead log starvation frequent failure failure is happening many transactions are time out ok your request we have put time out that time out system hanged your response came ok you are understanding ok now what is the issue your startup didn't start before that customer dissatisfaction started you are in trouble what to do so is there any solution is there any solution so what is the first level solution that you put some type of performance optimization measures put some type of performance optimization that your query your request will be processed quickly or your app user experience is getting bad you can do it a little better ok you take a reasonable latency which according to human mind is not slow ok it is normal ok so you have to put some performance optimization or ultimately you have to scale your system why you have to scale because we have discussed from last two lectures if your api layer and one database if n number of requests if you scale out the database somehow ok so what happens that n requests are divided n by 2 n by 2 goes there and if you make one more replica then n by 2 goes there so something like this happens ok we will see how it happens so you have to basically scale your system now what are the patterns of scaling are going to be discussed ok so we understood problem statement is clear now we will see how we are going to move forward on this solution let's move forward let's apply the first pattern ok so I had said that we will study step by step manner that when what is the requirement and what is your problem statement according to that we will apply the option of feasible scaling we will directly increase the cost of your system I will not say directly that you do one thing in multiple continents you put data centers like big companies do like google like amazon right do like this I will not say like this ok so now we will do slowly how much booking was in your starting 30 booking is happening per minute 30 booking is happening per minute ok so no problem let's move forward first pattern is query optimization and connection pool implementation query optimization and connection pool implementation first pattern what we will do in this first of all before applying this optimization I can apply some cache type of optimization we know what is cache cache is a type of memory so you can store the frequently used data somewhere there is a type of memory you can memorize it and then what happens whenever you get that request again you hit it hit or miss you know in cache who doesn't know what is cache so you will cache frequently used data ok and what data which is non-dynamic data now dynamic data will come from your DBMS means from your server ok we know we have client which is your app which you made of capp booking and this is your database and where is database on cloud where is database everything is gone let's take it again this was your app this was your database ok and where was database on cloud so your client server type relation right client and this is server ok so the data which is on your client's mobile ok which type of data history of booking ok and user profile user profile booking history payment history some things which you can store on your client's phone booking history you can store recently one month's booking history ok you can't do it for one year you can do it for one month ok same you can store payment history for one month on application layer means on your mobile ok so this type non-dynamic frequently used data because your app on app a person can click booking history so after clicking booking history you can fetch tomorrow's booking history from server it's better you some recent one month's booking which is basically one or two mb data you can store application data in this means in your app means store in mobile store in client ok can do so non-dynamic why non-dynamic because last one month's booking is non-dynamic change will not happen now it is showing last one month's 10 booking then later it will not show 20 booking change will not happen and dynamic data what happens here dynamic data you have like in cab booking what is the location of drivers ok now what will be the current cost to go from A point to B point right to go from A point to B point what will be the best route ok all these things are non-dynamic data what is the status of traffic ok sorry all this is dynamic data ok all this is dynamic data which how much traffic you have to go to ASB distance of ASB what will be the minimum distance what will be the current scenario what is the information of your drivers which cab is where all this is dynamic data so what will you do with non-dynamic data you will do pool means how will you do where on the application on client and the rest what will you do further in query optimization introduce database redundancy ok what will we do suppose if you have seen that your database is SQL database and it is very heavily normalized now you know ok who has studied the normalization lecture he knows this topic which we are discussing all these things are required that you have many topics that is the important topics normalization etc etc SQL non-redundant if you know all these things then only you will understand this whole lecture ok then only you will be master of database ok let's move forward so you saw that your database SQL database is very heavily normalized you have applied normalization up to BCNF ok so now because it is heavily normalized then what will happen what was the meaning of normalization you until redundancy is removed you break the tables means same information is stored in multiple tables one here one here many tables ok many tables have information spread out so because it is heavily normalized if you want some x information ok any information then you run query like this which hits all these tables and joins and by joining your query's output comes so you see that your data is heavily normalized ok because you studied in school or college that normalization is very good normalization should be applied ok your database is very good it is less redundant ok you have read all this so you see but because of this problem is coming because of this your user experience is getting spoiled remember for this only your new SQL database is used ok let's go back so you see that your data is highly normalized you have seen that your where or the queries of join are taking a lot of time so it is better that you add some redundant columns ok adding redundant columns means that you have break down in two tables you had a table when you were applying normalization you had break down that table in two tables while doing normalization now you take them back to the same table ok go up a little no problem your redundancy has come so you can see that your query of joins is decreasing and your query latency means the performance of query is increasing ok so you will apply something like this or it is better that you don't use SQL database you use SQL database remember the most important advantage of it was that it can be horizontal scale it had redundancy in it right one data related data was stored in one package you used to get one year you used to get but you used to ignore that data ok so your aim here is that if the performance is high then what you will do you will introduce some redundancy or you will do no SQL database ok who has seen SQL no SQL video must have understood everything ok very good what else you can do one thing is your cache DB connections suppose this is your server ok this is your client client application the code of client application is written code is written in that in multiple places your communication with DB is there DB communication means it will connect DB in multiple places which is in your code ok so this is the code ok so now you see whenever DB connect call comes in the code it establishes a new client to server communication communication establishes ok it establishes a connection it establishes this connection and through this connection through this connection your server client communication happens ok now what is the problem in this whenever any connection is created from client to server because connection is created through internet ok there are some queues that connection will be established or not ok there are many protocols so it is costly in terms of time complexity because their time complexity is more so it is better whenever you call DB connect in code then don't establish new connection again and again you must be understanding I will establish new connection it is better that I make a connection pool first make 4-5 connections first make 4-5 connections I have made connection 1-2-3 and all the different threads thread 1 thread 2 thread 3 which is running in your client application they reuse these connections again and again ok reuse what does this mean you have made a pool of connection pool of connection connection between client application and database server and you have made pool of connection now again and again you have to establish new connection so instead of you are doing you are using the same old connection again and again so what will be the benefit the biggest benefit from this is that I this latency or performance issue is coming the issue of performance is coming that in creating connection again and again the issue of performance will be gone ok so how to do for this to do this you have whatever library you are using spring springboard whatever library you are using in it you can write in your own library you can use them cache db connections ok this is a very famous term this is a very famous optimization ok connection pool implementation you can do this in google ok very good so we said multiple application thread will use the same db connection multiple application thread will use same db connection ok now you see that you one two and three these three you put query optimization you put query optimization what will happen your application user experience will be good now the user the customers are happy they say update came or you update your database update the app after updating now a good level of optimization you are getting why because your query the request is limited and 30 bookings per minute right 30 bookings per minute so according to this it is looking good ok experience is coming now you scale your business you show the scope you got some money you took the fund and you scale your system in one city your system your booking app scale it and you see 100 bookings per minute is coming now you are very happy that 100 bookings per minute is coming but what is the problem now you are seeing that this is ok but again significant performance drop came ok you are seeing latency is increasing again again app is getting sluggish getting slow ok API latency is increasing again now you are thinking what to do now you have put all these optimizations then also why it is happening because after one point all these optimizations are according to 30 bookings per minute it was ok but because 100 bookings per minute is happening your app is again gone bad customers are saying what nonsense app is you are again in tension now you have seen what can I do in the second pattern because I used a tiny machine in starting right I didn't spend I picked up an old machine now why I don't do this that I should scale up the system you have AI in your mind you have opened task manager of your system you see that your CPU is 80% busy now current your system server system your CPU is busy till 30% 80% sorry 80-90% your RAM is also full some things crash so you are seeing that your system is not handling current request properly now you know that system was useless what are you thinking that I should not do this now I have a new latest latest i9 processor or apple m2 chip good ok I will keep macbook pro system ok you have thought so you went to market what you did you upgraded your initial tiny system you doubled RAM you did SSD 3 times ok you have seen till your pocket was friendly like I told you to scale up is always costly ok but you have seen that you have a limit till which limit I can scale up you have kept whatever you see you have kept best you have scaled up your system till where till your pocket friendly till point till your pocket friendly point you can scale up ok the more you scale the more your cost will increase exponentially we have talked now because we have scaled after scaling what is happening now you have seen performance performance\u7537 if you had muscle knights more more and more groups so inside mr because there are a lot of good things in au start D go right on a few steps start to go to name something hospital capacity Because my app is very good and people are using it. Cap drivers are also happy who are using your app. And the customer, the end customer is also happy. So if you are happy then your business is growing. You have decided to scale in 3 more cities. Now you are seeing that you are getting 300 bookings per minute. That means your number of bookings has become 3x. Now you are seeing again that the problem has come again. The problem has come again. Your system is asking for constant maintenance. In that you have done indexation again and again. Index has also become slow. After index has become slow, your cost of scale up will also increase. Because you have thought that pattern 1 and pattern 2. Pattern 1 has only existed here. 100 bookings per minute. Now because 300 bookings per minute have happened. Now also you are facing a problem. Now you can't scale up. You can't scale up pattern 2. Because you need a lot of money to apply pattern 2. You have invested all that money in scaling your business. Now what will you do? Now you will want to choose a better option. What is that better option? We will do command query responsibility segregation. It is called CQRS. It is a very famous technique. Because you have seen that you have set up a new big machine. We have set up a big machine by scaling up. Because of which your money also got over. You checked that it is not able to handle all the read and write requests. You can see here. Query, responsibility, segregation. So we will do something like this. Read requests and write requests. We will segregate them. We will separate read requests and write requests. We will separate read requests and write requests. That is, let's draw once. We are applying pattern 3. You used to get n requests. After getting n requests, you saw that n by 2. Let me take a help. n by 2 request was your read request. And n by 2 was your write request. You saw that rather than giving both read and write requests to the same big machine. It is better that I change both of them physically. Now what you will do. You had an initial machine. We all know that you had an initial machine. You made two replicas of it. Because you want to segregate read and write requests. You made two replicas. Now we will say that this is your primary machine. And this is the replica. Sound is like clustering. Clustering is increased. We are applying clustering so well. We will segregate read and write requests. I call this CQRS. Now I will do that your requests come here. Your requests come here. If there is any write request. Suppose there is a write request. If there is a write request. I commit to the write request by going to the primary. That is, write request handles the primary. And write request always needs transactional properties. Assets properties are required. Write request should be successful. So my primary machine. It will work like write. It will handle all the write requests. And all the read requests. All the read requests. They will go to your replicas. Replicas which is the replica of primary. They will be useful for read requests. And primary will be useful for write requests. Okay. And you know that from primary to time to time. Replicas are replicated. Data. I call this data replication. Because write queries are coming on primary. Now because write queries are coming on primary. So there will be some new change in primary. Okay. If there was any value of x equal to 10 in primary. Okay. Your read request is being read from here x equal to 10. Okay. Now on primary you have made x 20 instead of 10. Now because you have made it 20 instead of 10. So this 20 value. Replicate. You should also replicate in replicas. Because all the read requests are going on replicas. So because all the read requests are going on replicas. So you have to replicate this 20 value here. Okay. So there is some design like this. Time to time replication keeps going on. Now you will get a question. Suppose a read request came. And it made x 20 instead of 10. Now because x is made 20 instead of 10. And I said that replication is done time to time. So suppose after 1 minute there is replication here. Not 1 minute. After 5-6 seconds replication is done. And before that some read request came. And it made x equal to 10 read. Okay. So you will say that I made it 20 1 minute before. How is this 10 coming. So your business logic is okay for this thing. It accepts this thing. That write should be done properly. No problem. Read should be done right after 1-2 times. Okay. I will give you an example of this. When you are using the app. You see that slowly. Your. Like the food delivery is going on. Your cab booking is coming. Cab booking. Cab is coming. So it is moving very slowly. It has moved here and there. Or the ETA is showing. ETA is changing slowly. It is not changing frequently like this. Or the driver's car is not coming towards you slowly. Now it is much better. But it moves suddenly. It has been seen in the Zomato. Quickly. So it is like this because in read. You have put lag in read. Okay. You are doing read late. You are doing read late. Now it is showing that the application is running from the back. Okay. Your write has been done. The system knows that the coordinates of my primary DB have changed. It is here. But your client. Because the client is reading from the replica. Because the client is reading from the replica. So the value in the replica has not changed. No problem. You can see that your car is a little bit here. It is okay. Right. So you have no problem. Your business logic is not creating any problem in this thing. You are acceptable to this thing. Okay. You just have to do this. Write your primary DB. It is always correct. Right. Your write is not changing. Okay. So you have to do this. Okay. So you have to do this. Write your primary DB. It should always be consistent. There should be latest information in it. Replicas will be replicated sometimes. Okay. So you must have understood that in CQS how I have diverted read and write request. I said that n by 2 is read request and n by 2 is write request. So the way read request is going. The way replicas is reading. And read request is not going to do any transaction here. It is not going to change the data. So what will happen with this. Read request will work very fast. Read request will work very fast. And write request will keep on writing on primary. So you can see that. So you have to do this. So you have to do this. So you have to do this. So you have to do this. So you have to do this. So you have to do this. So it will keep on doing this. So you have to see that number of request I have divided. Okay. I have divided it in 3 places. Not in end by 2 but end by 3. You have divided it in 3 places. Some are going in this place and others in that place. So you will see. So with this way I have applied the clustering. CQS I am using it command query responsibility segregation. Read and write request in one place. Read request in primary in one place. What will be the benefit of this. You will see your performance a little better. Okay. Let's see the formula, all read request is sent on replicas and all write request is sent on primary. Your business is growing well. Now you thought again that you will go to two more cities. Why? Because now you saw that your primary is not able to handle all write request. You might have a question that you have applied this pattern 3 for now. Now 300 booking per minute is going well. But if you will move further on new cities then what will happen? If you will request on new cities then pattern 3 will also fail. So it is written here that your business is growing well and you went to two more cities. Your app again got a problem and you saw that because there was only one primary here. Because there was only one primary here which was handling write request. And you made replicas 2. Now you see that all read request of your primary app is not able to handle write request. Primary is not able to handle all write request. Now what problem you are facing? Again your app is getting logish. This thing will always be constant. That's why we will be able to read the next pattern. So lag between primary and replicas is impacting user experience also. Now I told you that there is a slight lag between primary and replicas. There is a slight lag between data. It is okay. But now because I told you that there is a lot of lag. Because of this, write request has increased a lot. And you have moved to two cities. Now your 300-500 booking permit is coming. Because of this, write request has increased a lot. Now the write machine, this primary machine has slowed down. Now because it will slow down, the acceptable time of replication of data has also slowed down. Now again your user experience has ultimately declined. Now what will you do? Now you will apply the third level of pattern. The third level of pattern is multiple primary replication. This must have come in your mind. That make multiple primary. You have made multiple read. Make multiple primary. Make multiple replicas for read. Make multiple primary for write. So we will do something like this. Multi primary replication. Now what is multi primary replication? Let's understand it. Once. In this we will say that why not distribute write queries to replicas also. That is, how to implement it. I will tell you once. Pattern 4. Pattern 4 which is multi primary replication. What I do in this? Now what you did? Two machines were made. In pattern 3, one was your primary machine. Two replicas were coming after you. Replicas were used for read. Primary was used for write only. Now again suppose. 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay. Made four machines. Made four replicas. Okay. And I am not calling anyone primary in this. Okay. There is no primary, there is no replica. Okay. Ultimately, all replicas are there. Okay. That means there is a cluster of each other. There is a replica in each of them. And what is replica? Let me remind you again. In replica same database schema, same data. Everything, the index, everything, all set of tables same. That means database A is equal to database B is equal to database C is equal to database D. Okay. They are copies of each other. Okay. Okay. I have reminded you. So what you did? Made four. A, B, C, D. Okay. All four of them are what here? All machines can work as primary and replica. All are primary. All are replica. So what you did? You made four. A, B, C, D. Okay. All four of them are what here? All machines can work as primary and replica. All are primary and all are replica. So what happens in this? Where is replication. This works like a circle, suppose. B will replicate data from A. Okay. B will replicate data from A. Let me draw this. B will replicate data from A. Okay. C will replicate data from B. And C will replicate data from D. And D will replicate data from A. Okay. Okay. So in this way only data can be replicated. So it works like a circle, B will check A every few seconds to see if there is any update, if there is an update then replicate it. C will check B in a while to see if there is any update in B's database, if there is an update then replicate it. D will check C and A will check D. So it works like a ring. Now how will you do the main work in this? How will you do segregation? You have N request coming in. It also has read and write requests. Now what will you do? If any write request comes, you will write it and give it to any random node. Any node will handle it. How will any node handle it? Suppose you had a problem in pattern 3, because write request was increasing a lot. Now because write request has increased a lot, so you had only one primary which was handling write. Now we have said that there is no such thing as primary and secondary, or there is no such thing as primary and replica. Every node can read and write. You have made multiple nodes for that sake. Now what will you do? Suppose you have N or M request of write, then you will give it to any node. Any Nth request will come and it will go to any node. And because it will write to any node, after writing, in a circular form, which I am calling multi primary replication, in a circular form, if any update comes on A, then B will replicate it and B will not. If A will replicate, then C will replicate, D will replicate. So now if you have M request, then M request will be distributed. Earlier, M request would go on only one primary. Now M request will be distributed. There is no harm in distribution because your replication is running. And how will you read? To read, you will broadcast read. Any read request will be broadcast. After broadcast, any note will reply first. I will send the answer to your client. Because still, I expect a little lag of read and write. No problem. There should not be more than one level of lag. It should not be like that your cab driver has left your sub-darkness. He has left Dholakoma. But he has come to your home. But he is still showing you that he is at Dholakoma. It should not be like that. A little lag is okay. That's what I am doing here. You will choose any note by taking the write request. And because all the machines can handle write requests, they will replicate it. You will broadcast read request. The machine will reply first. I will use its data. Because you read read request again and again. There should be a little lag in read and write. This question should be clear in your mind. There will be a little lag in read and write. But there should be acceptable lag. Let's see the formula. All machines will work like primary replica. There is no primary replica machine here. All the replicas are made in a cluster. All the machines can handle read and write. But there is a way. Let's make a logical ring. Let's take the sub-date. Write data to any note. Write on any note. Choose any note. Choose the one with less write request. Pick that and give the write request. That's it. Replication will handle all these things. Let's see the read request. Let's reply to any note. Let's see the read request. Let's broadcast on sub. Let's see the reply. Now you have seen that your current things are done. You are happy for now. Now you have expected. Now you have thought that why not scale your business again. Your business is going well. You are very lucky. Suppose you have scaled your business. Now because you have scaled your business, your system is in pain again. Again you are facing problems. Now your business is famous for 50 requests per second. But your user experience is getting worse. Now what will you do? You have applied very good optimization. Now what will you do? One more optimization which is very famous is your partitioning of data by functionality. Partitioning is read in front. But here we will partition by functionality. New note. New note. Now we will make our database. What will we do? What about separating the location tables in separate DB schema? What does it mean? You had one database. We had made replicas of it. You had applied T primary replication. You have reached pattern 4. Now you are facing problem again. It is better that you partition the data by functionality. What does it mean? It means that you have one database. There are many tables in it. There are many tables. There are many functionality. Some mix of, some set of tables. Some 5 set of tables together provide one functionality. Some more 5-6 tables together provide one functionality. Some more 5-6 tables together provide one functionality. Like Some tables you have made by longitude, latitude and location database. These 5 databases or these 5 tables give information of location at any point of time. Okay? Similarly What will be your current cost of your whole journey? You can take out that 5 set of tables. Okay? Now you can separate the tables of location. All the location specific tables put them in a separate DB schema. Separate DB schema. You are not distributing the database. You are separating the database. You had one database. You have made another database. Its functionality is that it provides location specific data. Location specific works in that separate database schema. Remember we have changed the schema. We have changed the schema. But about putting the DB in a separate machine. And this separate DB schema put it in a separate machine. With primary replica and multi primary configuration. We have read the primary replica configuration. We made a separate machine. After making a separate machine I have made location. And put it in a separate machine. Now this separate machine because it can have a load of requests. This can also be sluggish. So you have made it a primary replica. This is a primary replica. This is a replica. Primary will handle all write requests. And replica read requests. Or put it in a multi primary configuration. It is up to you. You can do anything. Different DB can host data categorically by different functionality. Here we are dividing database schema functionality wise. Logically functionality wise. But what will be the problem with this? See that. Pattern 5.1 We have come to the point. You had a database. This was your database. I call it cab app database. It had all the information. Customer, booking history. Everything was yours. Location was also in it. You made a separate database. This database was of 5 GB. You saw that 2 GB data was your location specific data. Location specific. So you said that you have given the name of the database. Location DB And the schema of both these DBs is different. They are not same. They are independent. Now because they are independent. They don't relate. So what is your work now? This is in another machine. Machine 2. And this is in machine 1. Now your application. This is your client. This is your client app. This is your client app. Now you have to write one more layer. Let's make it in another color. You have to write one more layer. What will that layer do? Suppose the client requested something. Now in that request you have to write the name of the client. And Now in that request first when you didn't separate both the DBs. That the location data was in the DB. So now what used to happen? You used to get the whole answer from this. But now what is it? Now because the information you are asking Some information is here. Ok. Some info. And some of your info is here. And So the information in the separate machines is being mixed and your client application is trying to run some query. So you have to write a layer. What will this layer do? It will send some query here. And here it will send some query. And those query will be logically joined here. Ok. Your results will be logically joined. Because your client doesn't know that you have changed the DB. Ok. Client is abstract from all these things. He doesn't know what is going on in the system. Now you have to write a layer. What will that layer do? It will send some request here and here. And it will handle both the requests. And logically it will merge the data of both the requests. And after merging it will output. Ok. I didn't understand. I will repeat it again. First you ran some location specific query. In which there was location, cap driver information, customer information. Because the location was stored here. The tables were stored here. So you ran that query here. But now what you have to do is you have to segregate that query in a way that I will get some information from here. Suppose I will get customer information from here. But location information will be from here. And cap driver information will also be from here. Ok. So you have to segregate something and run query in both the places. After running query in both the places you have to logically join the results and output. This is a very trivial problem. Which we do on the servers. Ok. Different different You run the schema and merge the query. You create JSON file and send it back. Ok. We will do something like this. So I am saying this partitioning by functionality. You partitioned by functionality. But what is the problem with this? On the application layer or on the backend. Not application layer but client application. Here you created a layer on the backend. There you have a responsibility to join the results. This responsibility increases a little. But that is no-bain no-gain. You have to work a little. If you want to get something then you have to do something. You have to work a little. Very good. Now let's move forward. Now you have planned that you have targeted 20-25 cities in your country. Now you don't want to go to other cities because you know that your business will not come. What I do is that I scale in other country. So now you thought that let's expand your business somewhere else. Let's go to Singapore. Now when you took your business your system your DB your system is in your country. Now because you have started in US or let's take US. You have started in US. You have started in New York. Now they are facing a problem. Why? Because when you get a request through notes from US on your Indian server then the latency increases. Country wise now there is a problem. Now what will you do? Now you will scale your system horizontally. You will scale out. How will you scale out? We will apply sharding. Now we were doing clustering but now we will scale out formally. In scale out we will apply sharding. What is sharding? The database you have you established 50 machines. You had this database. Sharding you remember it. We do it horizontally. You did sharding. You applied 50 machines. You took 50 machines of your same configuration. Now you have a schema in the same database. Remember that in the sharding video it was a schema of student. But each machine holds just a part of data. Some part of data every machine keeps. Initially it was your machine. Suppose in this whatever data you had there were N rows of data. Now you took 50 machines and made them N by 50. And in 50 machines the machines you made you put N by 50 data N by 50 rows in this machine. N by 50 rows in this machine. N by 50 rows in this machine. So in this way you took many machines and kept the same schema in it. But the information which is your rows you divided it in different machines. Each machine just holds a part of data. A part of data is held and the machine has sharding, horizontal, partitioning. You must have understood. But you have to maintain the locality of data. One machine should have local data so that it doesn't have to switch in the machines again and again. Each machine can have their own replica. Every machine can have its own replica. We will use that for failure recovery. Now you know that in sharding we discussed a problem that when we do sharding there is a slight problem that you have to bear a little pain on the backend layer. So sharding is not necessary hard to apply. But we all know that no pain is no gain. If you don't take pain then how will you gain? Now you have seen that you applied sharding. After applying sharding you have scaled out. Now your system is working well. Now the new countries in Singapore or New York where you scaled, your system is working well. 50 machines are handling it well. Because how your 50 machines will work? Because your machine has some data so your requests are divided. Because you went to new region number of requests increased. Latency increased. To decrease latency you scaled out. You have done 50 machines. Now all the requests are divided in 50 machines. And you have applied your own replica system for failure recovery. Very good. You have applied sharding in this way. It was fun. Now we have seen that your business is going to run on a global scale. You have to go to multiple countries. Now you have moved to one country. You have gone from India to New York. Now you need many cities of New York. You need many cities of Singapore. You need many cities of Europe. Now your business is matured so much that it can go across continents. But the sharding you applied in India multiple machines were applied in India. But now when your business has scaled worldwide then so many requests will come. Now your system is running at peak of your business. You are going to earn a lot of money. But your system has decreased. Latency increased. App experience is not good. People in India are happy. They are enjoying. But the user experience of foreign countries is getting worse. Now what will you do? Now third and last pattern you will apply. Data center wise partition. You must have understood. What will we do? Now because requests from across continent are travelling with high latency. From here to here. Why not I distribute my traffic which is getting requests worldwide across data centers. How will I do this? Let's see. You will make data centers. Suppose you made a data center. I say data center 1. In Europe. You made a data center. In Singapore. You made a data center. In India. You made a data center. In India. You made a data center. In New York. You made a data center. In New York. So you have made some. You have made some. Suppose you have made some data centers. Now what will you do? Whatever is your South Asian traffic. That means whatever is your traffic in South Asia. You will send it to India's database. Or you will send it to data center. Or you will send it to Singapore's data center. As many as there are many countries in South Asia. You have scaled out your business in all those countries. So what will you do? All the requests related to your South Asian country. All of them you will send to Singapore. And India. And India's database. And keep in mind that all the database is same. All the database is same. Ok. You have made relevant copies of this database. You have made relevant copies of this database. And you have kept it in different countries. That the countries around that country. And the country's. All the requests will go to that data center. So what will happen? Latency will also decrease. And your requests will also be divided. We are doing this from the beginning. Because we have scaled. So scale the continental-wise request. All the requests related to Europe and Russia. We will send them to Europe's data center. All the requests related to South Asia, we will send them to Europe's data center. All the requests related to US We will send them to the data center in New York. We will send them to the data center in New York. So what will you do with this? You have established across country your data center. And across country your data is distributed across the country and your requests are divided across the continent South Asian requests are going to the data center of India and Singapore Europe and Russia requests are going to the data center of Europe and America requests are going to the data center of America You can also install other data centers like this Suppose you can install your own data center in Russia We have to keep one thing in mind that we have enabled cross data center replication You may have a question that why cross data center replication? Because customers of Europe are of Europe only So all the data of customers of Europe should be in Europe only I keep it in Europe only Why keep all the data in India or Singapore servers? It's a good thing But this will cause a problem Suppose how your Europe database and data center How to do it? It's a problem It's not working If it's not working then your system's availability Your cab booking app which is so famous Its availability will be over We have read availability and we have to keep it high So what you will do? Keep cross data center replication That means in some time these data centers keep on replicating each other Because they keep on replicating each other So if Europe's data center doesn't work for some reason For some reason it gets spoiled for 1-2 hours Then you can send all the requests of Europe to Singapore or India There will be some latency Some apps will run sluggishly But your availability will be high Your availability will be high for 1-2 hours No problem After some time when your data center will revive from Europe You will redirect those requests to Europe So you can see how good the design patterns are 7 design patterns are made That you can send your requests to Europe only You can take your small app to world level That means how much can you take? To world level Ok Good So you took across country Your distributed database is made to world level Your app is running very well Your app is making a sensation in every country Very good You have maintained your availability very well Your business is running well You have become unicorn Worldwide your brand is made Now what you will do? Now you will apply for IPO Ok You will apply for IPO If you don't know IPO then google it You will apply for IPO And you will be a big company Very good So you have read these 7 data scaling patterns This is very important And you can see that at every point We are doing something different Ok Now you have seen that What I used to do Clustering How we are doing clustering here also Clustering is a basic concept Which we have read in a video But clustering is being applied here also Primary application Clustering is being applied here also Primary application is also kept here Primary application Primary application But here what is We are not dividing the requests on read write basis Ok Then you have read that how we partition data Functionally wise Ok We have put the data in the new schema only Right We have put the data in the new schema only We did this Very good And then we have read the sixth How you scale out You make multiple charts You have established 50 machines Establish 100 machines Keep the schema same Divide the data in row wise Remember we had read in student First 10,000 students in one machine Second 10,000 students in another machine Something like this We have done the charting And then data center We have done the data center wise partition Very good So I hope you have understood this video well Ok So good It was a very interesting video Write in the comment section Did you understand or not If you did not understand Then watch this video again Read the notes well You will understand everything Ok And if you have watched all the important concepts videos Then you will be very happy Or you must have been very excited How we have applied all the concepts live And making our own startup Very good Let's meet in the next lecture Till then goodbye"}

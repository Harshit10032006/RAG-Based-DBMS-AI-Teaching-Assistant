    "text": " Hello, how are you all? This is Lakshay. We are back with our DBMS lecture number 20. Today we are going to discuss something very important which is related to distributed storage. Whenever you work in cloud systems or when your database becomes very big and you have to serve multiple requests, then what do you do? We can scale up the system to a certain level and then scale out. We do horizontal scaling and make multiple nodes. We make replicas. We have read all this. So whenever replicas are made, your cloud system is being made, distributed storage is being made, then a theorem is very useful in it to design efficient distributed storage. Whenever you have to make efficient distributed storage, you have to take care of some things. And what is that thing? It is available to you in the form of theorem proof. I call it CAPE theorem. CAPE theorem. So what is CAPE theorem? Before understanding what CAPE theorem is, let's see what is CAPE in CAPE. First is consistency. Second is availability. Third is partition tolerance. And you will say, this is a consistency. What is CAPE? CAPE is a partition tolerance. Consistency, availability, we are reading this for a long time. What is consistency? What should be availability? Whenever multiple nodes are available, it should be available. Partition tolerance seems something new. But I will briefly discuss all three things. What is consistency? Whenever your database will be spread on multiple nodes, replicas will be made, then the values of data on all nodes should be the same. If the value of X is 10 on node A, then it should be 10 on node B. So it is very important that the data across the nodes is consistent. So this is your consistency property. How will this happen? When data is written on single node, then it should be replicated or broadcasted to other nodes in the system. We understand this. We are reading consistency for a long time. Second is availability. What is availability? In distributed databases, what is availability? It means that the system remains operational all the time. That means if you have multiple nodes and some nodes fail, then your system should be available. There should be some latency or delay, but the system should be available. In the last lecture, we did data center-wise partitioning to make the system available. Every request will get a response regardless of the individual state of the node. This is the availability of the system. What is partition tolerance? Partition is your node A. Understand this. Suppose this is the primary node and this is the replica node. You have to establish communication between these nodes. Why? Suppose this was a single database in the beginning, but as your system grew, you made multiple replicas to serve the requests. We understand this. You made multiple replicas, so you have to establish communication between them to replicate. So if partitioning is done, what does partitioning mean? The communication between nodes is to break. The break of communication is partition. What happens if partitioning is done? So what is partition tolerance? If partitioning is done, your system should be tolerant. What happens in that? When a distributor system encounters a partition, if the communication link is broken by mistake, it means that there is a break in communication between the nodes. Communication is broken. Okay? If the system is partition tolerant, then the system will not fail. The system will not fail. The system will remain up. There may be delays or inconsistencies in the messages, but the system will remain up. To have partition tolerance, the system must replicate records across a combination of nodes and networks. To have partition tolerance, when your system is up and the communication link is established, you have to replicate. Okay? So partition tolerance means this. Your system is partition tolerant. Partition is done, but the system is not failing. It is working. Okay? Now, what does your CAPE theorem say? CAPE theorem says that consistency, availability, partition tolerance, these three things cannot come together. That is, whenever you make a distributor system, only two properties will be able to exist simultaneously. None of these three properties will be able to exist. So, the system is partitioned. So, the system is partitioned. So, the system is partitioned. So, the system is partitioned. So, the system is partitioned. The three properties will not be able to exist. The three properties will not be able to exist. Or when can the three properties exist? We can give hypothetical examples. If you have a single node, the database that you have made, or a small application, is a single node. It is in one computer. It is a single node. So, in that case, partition will not happen. In that case, partition will happen or not. Because you have a single node. You have not divided it into multiple nodes. And partitioning means this. It means that communication breaks between multiple nodes But you haven't generated multiple nodes You have all the data on one node You have one computer in your system One system In that case, the difference of partition tolerance doesn't increase Partitioning can't happen Right? If you have a single node database It means that there is no distributed system There is only one node If there is no distributed system Then all the three things will happen But if there is distributed system Then you can establish only two of these properties at once Right? Or in other words The theorem formalizes trade-off between consistency and availability When there is a partition If there is a partition, communication breaks Linkage breaks Then you will get a trade-off between consistency and availability So take consistency or availability Let's understand this Simple Through example You are a user We have made two nodes for you Suppose this is your database First of all There will be a single database It will be on single DB or single node But your system has become very big You kept scaling Your system became so large And when there is a large system You have to make it distributed You have to divide it into multiple nodes Because requests are so high And you have to keep the latency low We have read all this in the last lecture I am reminding you again So what you have done In node A and node B You have divided this Suppose there are replicas of each other I call this as primary node That is, all these operations will handle write I call this as secondary node Or I call this as replica All this will handle read operation Ok Very good So now Simple thing is The proof of the theorem The proof of the type of the theorem How is this true If you are doing your write operation here Ok And you are doing read operation from here And suppose you have partitioned Partitioning is done What was the meaning of partitioning? The break of communication What will happen if partitioning is done? If partitioning is done Then I am saying There will be a trade-off Either take consistency or availability How is that? When you Suppose you have partitioned And you said That I will serve both the requests Ok Write will also work Read will also work No problem Both should work But what will happen with this Your consistency Will be lost When will it happen? When you will say That both requests Should process Ok Now you will be a little confused How is this? That when you Do write operation here Ok Write operation You wrote here x equal to ten Ok But because partitioning is done here Your communication linkage is break Now because this linkage network is down Break is there So your replication will not be possible Now replication will not be possible And read operation came So that x's previous value was suppose twenty So twenty will be returned Rather than ten So the latest write operation That will not be able to read Ok So if you said That I will keep the system available You are keeping both the systems available Both the nodes are available When I keep the system available I will keep both the systems available By establishing highly availability By keeping both the systems available What will happen by keeping available Your consistency will be lost Ok We understood this Second I will tell you the second How availability will be lost How availability will be lost? In this I will say if We fail one request Suppose As soon as partitioning happened You said that Read operation will not be done Read operation will not be done As soon as partitioning happened Read operation will not be done So you have written x equal to ten Now because you wanted to keep the system consistent And you know that partitioning has happened So you also know that If any read operation happened During the partition Then what will happen It will be inconsistent read Previous value of x will be read So you thought that it is better than this That I will close the system Return this failed Now if it has failed request Bad request Or return failed So you have lost availability So whenever partitioning will happen Either consistency will be lost Or availability will be lost Ok One of the two will be less So this is what your CAP theorem wants to say Ok Very good Let's move forward And keep in mind that If the system is complete That is, it is one node Single node There is no problem in single node Why there is no problem in single node Because there is no partition problem in single node There is a single node If this node is single Node is single So in that case Will there be anything like partition It can't happen It can't happen Partition means The linkage of communication between two distributed nodes Ok Very good Now let's move forward Now we will say In CAP theorem We said that You can establish only two of the three properties at once Ok So let's see how databases are Which I said Two of the three properties So this is how its Venn diagram is made That these three properties Simultaneously can't exist But they have an intersection Of two properties Either you take CA Or take CP Or take IP Ok Let's read this Let's understand what it means What happened to CA Consistency And availability That is, the consistency of the system will provide Availability will also provide And now we have seen one second ago That consistency and availability Can't be provided together If partition is done Then This means that CA databases They are not partitioned Partition does not mean They are not distributed They are on the same node Ok That's why it is said CA database enables consistency and availability Across all the nodes Ok Now here Nothing like all the nodes Unfortunately CA cannot deliver fault on Venn In any distributed system Ok Distributed system is We don't use MySQL We have seen this Right Partition are bound to happen Because whenever there is a distributed system Partition is always there If you You said By using MySQL DB I make a distributed system Ok And linkage it But he is saying He is trying to say That if you use MySQL And then You use MySQL Ok And Consistency and Availability Both established Consistency should also be Availability should also be But Can you keep both consistency and availability You can't keep Because Whenever there is a distributed system Your partitioning is fixed It happens It happens sometimes That your linkage breaks For some time If there is a linkage break for some time Then You can't say That consistency Availability Will be There is a linkage Ok Did you understand I repeat it again CA database is saying We will have the consistency and we will be available Now we will be available consistent It's cap theorem speaking That the consistency of available You can't be able to If partition is done If partition is done So You can't be consistent I'm sorry If partition is done Consistent and available Both of them can't be together But CA's database says That both of us are consistent and available Both of us will be So This is not practical It's not practically possible Because If there is any distributed system Then If partitioning is done then trade-off will occur between consistency and availability Either you make a system where partitioning is not possible Or you establish your system in one node and partitioning will not happen So it is impractical. This means this type of databases is not practical choice That is being said you can still find CA databases if one Relational databases like MySQL, Postgre provide both consistency and availability But if you use them in distributed system and there is linkage then partitioning will occur If partitioning occurs then there will be problem So you have to take trade-off between consistency and availability Ok So you can ensure that partitioning will not happen I will make a distributed system using MySQL but I will not allow partitioning So this is a little impossible and impractical It may be possible on small scale but not practical on big scale Now let's study CP database CP means Consistent and Partition Tolerant This means as we have read either consistency will be lost Either availability will come or consistency will occur Whenever the system will be partition tolerant What does partitioning mean? Even after partitioning your system is working If it is partition tolerant then either you take consistency or availability So it is possible to use both these types of databases practically So what does CP database say? It gives consistency and partition tolerance but not availability When partition occurs, whenever there is a partition What happens in these types of databases? Whenever there is a partition, the system has to turn off nodes until the partition can be fixed What happens in these types of databases? What happens in CP databases? Whenever there is a partition, I will turn off node B And what happens after turning off? Availability will be lost We have seen this a little while ago Now availability will be lost and whenever the system will recover That is, the partitioning will be fine The system will recover and back to communication will come Communication will be established in both Then the work will be done So this is what we are saying here When a partition occurs, the system has to turn off inconsistent nodes This node Inconsistent node Until the partition is fixed When the partition is fixed, it will move from the cross and will be right After that we can move forward MongoDB is an example Which is a CP database It is consistent and partition tolerant The CP system is structured so that it is consistent and partition tolerant So that only primary nodes receive all the right operations in the given replica set In the architecture of CP, we use this architecture Make a primary node which will see all the right operations It will have replicas Secondary node replicates the data from primary So that if the primary fails, the secondary stands in Now what is its example? Availability is not very important in the banking system It doesn't matter See this system All your banking systems At night You leave on maintenance Or go in between So there is no much availability What matters there is consistency Consistency should be there Data It shouldn't be like this In one account, it is showing one lakh rupees In the other account In the same account It is showing two lakhs on the second node It shouldn't be like this The user will be happy that it is showing two lakhs Right So in banking system availability is not very important Consistency is important So we opt for MongoDB So in this case In which we implement the banking system You will use the CP type database Because whenever there is partition in it To tolerate the partition I turn off all your secondary nodes All your inconsistent nodes I turn them off It ends That is whenever there is a read operation Bad request will be returned Now because it will return bad request So your system will lose availability But we are not targeting availability So in CP Consistency and partition will be there In AP databases What is the AP database In AP databases Availability and partition tolerance is there But there is no consistency Right You must have understood I am talking about this That is what I will do in this case Whenever there is partitioning So what will I do in the partition tolerance act I will not do anything I will let both the nodes work Now when both the nodes work So if your business logic allows It doesn't want to be consistent There is no problem It is not consistent It will be consistent after a while So in this case Your both requests will be executed Will be executed in read Will be executed in write Will be executed in read Will be executed in write System will be a little inconsistent There is no problem After a while whenever recovery will happen This connection will be established again Through replication You will be inconsistent again Right So I call such a system eventually consistent OK So AP databases are eventually consistent Why Because whenever your partition tolerance will be That is, whenever the partition break is there The linkage that has happened The linkage that has happened The breakage that has happened Whenever it is right The link will be established again In that case Eventually data replication will happen And both the nodes will be consistent So that's why I call AP databases eventually consistent OK AP database enable Availability and partition tolerance But consistency is not there In the event of partition Whenever the partition happened OK Linkage Link breakage happened All the nodes are available All nodes are available Link break is done No problem To update your data Right But they are not updated Update cannot happen But they are not updated For example If a user tries to access data from a bad node Then they will not receive the most updated data So when I wrote X on this On this 10 When this node was also available So the return from here was X equal to 20 So the old power was reviewed But that is not a big deal No problem In AP databases It does not matter There is no target OK When the partition is eventually resolved When the partition will be resolved, When the partition will be resolved So in this case most AP databases will sync the node to ensure consistency Data replication will be done and it will be synced And this is called eventually consistent So it is very important to know that AP databases are eventually consistent So Apache Cassandra and Amazon Dynamo are examples of AP databases What is the use case of this? For example if you are implementing Facebook then we value availability more than consistency We value availability more than consistency In banking consistency matters more We give it more weightage We would offer AP databases like Cassandra and Amazon Dynamo Okay? Okay? Okay? So this was a brief of CAPETHERUM In which we understood what CAPETHERUM is And what is its usage Whenever you are making a database, banking system, social media website What type of databases will you use? Will you use AP databases, CP databases and CA databases? What is CA database? That you mostly use it when you are saying that there will be no partition Okay? So CA databases are basically impractical In case of distributed system Because in distributed system partition is decided Let's assume that Okay? If there is only one single node then you can use it Okay? Very good So I hope you have understood everything Okay? I will give you your homework It's been a long time since I gave you homework Homework is We have read that the banking system The banking system That your asset properties Follows Asset properties are a must in it Similarly I am saying that the social media Or the social networking websites The social networking systems They should have base properties Okay? Now what is the base property? Asset versus base properties Okay? It can be a simple interview question So you have to read what is the base property You have read about availability and consistency very well You will be very clear So I am damn sure that you will understand base properties easily So this is your homework Go and search base properties Or search for asset versus base property Let me tell you full form In base property, base means Basically available Okay? And second is your soft state Third is your eventually consistent Okay? So this is your homework So now And whoever will do the homework I would highly recommend that you In the comment section Their brief Comment on the brief Whatever you have read You comment on their brief definition Asset versus base property Can be an interview question And we have read a lot of this Availability, consistency, eventually consistent We have read all this So you will understand everything Eventually consistent I was saying a while ago What is eventually consistent? Okay? So I have told this I have told this too You will understand So this is your homework See you in the next lecture Till then Good bye"

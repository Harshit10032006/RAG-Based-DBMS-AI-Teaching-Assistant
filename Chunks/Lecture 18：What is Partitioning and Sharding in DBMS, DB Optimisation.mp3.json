    "text": " Hello, how are you all? This is Lakshay. So today I am going to discuss some very important topics on DBMS lecture number 18. Which is directly related to interviews. And if it is related to interviews, then the system you make in real life is used a lot. Whenever you are designing your system, DBMS has to be used in it. If you have data and you have to store it, then these concepts are used a lot. So before reading, let's discuss a normal problem once. If you have data, you have to store it. For this, who makes it easy to store it? DBMS, Data-Wise Management System. We have read this. Now suppose you have a lot of data. A lot. You have huge data. Okay. When you are making such applications that will serve a lot of people. Okay. Like you are making a website hosted on www. Okay. Its live example is Facebook. Facebook, Insta, Amazon. Right. You are making such applications in which you know that there will be millions of users, millions of requests. You will be storing a lot of data. Okay. Now if this data is your single data. If I store it in a single database. Okay. If I store it in a single database. So what will happen? That you will store it. But after a limit, your particular database system, the system in which you have stored it, the computer in which you have stored it, will be exhausted. Why will it be exhausted? In terms of, all the CPU, RAM will be finished. Okay. Why am I saying this? Because whenever you are making such a system, which is going to be used by a lot of people. There are going to be a lot of requests in it. Okay. And you have a lot of data. Okay. Thanks to them. What is Coding Ninjas? It is one of the largest coding platform where you can give a lot of courses. If you are interested in paid courses. If you want to do development. Do machine learning. Do Android. Do web development. Do C++. Do Coresubject. Do OSDBMS. Read something. Do DSA. Java, Python. In any language. So you can take those paid courses from here. The most beautiful thing that people praise Coding Ninjas is that doubt-resolving support is available here one on one. If you have any doubt, then give me a call. If you have any doubt, then it will be resolved in one to two hours. Courses are made in a very well-structured way. If you put in hard work, then you are definitely going to get the result. People who are making courses have already broken big companies. So you don't need to worry about it. If you talk about language, then Hindi and English are available in both. While solving the questions, you will get hints in the videos. So if you want to buy any paid course, then now you are smart. You have this link in the description. You can click on it and take it. And you will get a maximum of 20% discount. Thank you. So we discussed two things. That data. You have a lot of it. Second, there are a lot of requests. Let's say number of requests. So if you have data, then what will be the issue? Manageability. You will not be able to manage the data. You have a lot of data. How will you manage it? How will you manage it in one node? So the issue of manageability comes. You have the issue of dealing with it. You have a lot of data. So the issue of direction and depends on which, instead of determining the solution. Then the difference ofwiring the beta egg what is var. I will repeat it once, I have said three things, first of all, you have data, you have to store it, DBMS will do it for you, but when you have a very big system, If you have a very big system, you will design it, if you will store it in the same computer in the same database, then there will be a lot of data, then there will be an issue of its identity and it will not be able to serve many requests, why will it not be able to serve the request, because if there are many requests on the same database, If there are millions of requests, then it will be so difficult to serve them that after a point your system may crash or your system response time is very high, That one person is able to log in quickly or he is able to get the fetch, suppose I am an example of Amazon, you go and open your shopping cart, Your cart opened quickly, but the millions that you have, The ones who are sitting behind you, whose request is coming on your database, they are waiting for their own fetch, it is happening, it is happening, it is happening, So the response time will increase a lot, right, so when you have these two things, then how do you design the system, you want to distribute the system, That I distribute the system, let's come to this again, so you have to apply the database optimization technique, That is, That is, What does it do, it makes your data easily manageable, because you have a lot of data, second, reduces response time, The number of requests that are coming to you, you want that their response time will also decrease gradually, so what is the first way to do this, The first way is to scale up, we have read this in NoSQL, right, scale up means that you increase the hardware, increase the hardware, what is the problem with this, You have a system, you have increased the hardware, suppose you have 1TB hard disk in it, and the CPU was of xyz amount, right, and you had a lot of ram of x amount, You put this, now if you are scaling up, because your system has become very high, you have more data, use has become, okay, so you also make this 2TB, If the data is more, 2TB, the number of requests will be fast, so you have made xyz 2xyz, double xyz, that you have increased the number of requests, you have made xyz 2xyz, you have made ram 2x so it is practically seen that if you do this work suppose initially your system was like this then you used to get n number of requests now suppose you have 2n number of requests instead of n number and data is also 2n, sorry 2x, it has doubled so what will happen in this case I will scale up the system 1tb or 2tb, I will double the cpu and ram but practically if you do this work then your response time will not be half you will think that if I double everything then the response time will be half but practically it does not happen secondly, its cost also increases a lot now if you do 2tb ram from 1tb, the cost will increase if you increase the cpu, the cost will increase if you increase the ram, the cost will increase so this is an example this is an expensive bet so it is not logical to scale up in terms of money see, ultimately everything comes on money you are making the system, you want to make the system in that you want to make the system at least cost so what can you do in the second thing you can make replica sets what is replica set? clustering we have read in last lecture you can do clustering now what happens in clustering? in clustering you make copies of the same database instance means the database you had here this database you had here you will make a copy of this so all the data will replicate you ok redundancy is included we have read in last lecture but there is a problem in this too you have a master node and you have replicas so when there are updates updates updates always come on master and this master propagates those updates propagation of updates what comes from that propagation? delay how delay? you have to manage this thing that you are updating from here after updating, update should go on replicas ok this can eventually happen if one replica is updated and the other is not updated for now so because the update goes in synchronous so this type of problem can come so replica set is a way clustering is a very good way but there is one more level above one more better way which I call partitioning ok now let's read partitioning what is partitioning? partitioning is a way of scale out scale out we have read scale out horizontal scaling means we have to one single node we are not increasing its capacity we will partition the data we will bring new node clustering is also a horizontal scaling right you add more node you add different node in this in this also new nodes are added now let's see how this happens suppose you have student table student table what will happen in that? you will have name id ok and class let's call it render address and phone number ok and you will have many students ok so with partitioning I can understand something like this that I can do something which is my student table ok I know that it is too big right then we are applying all this this database optimization techniques we are applying then only when we are applying response time we want to reduce the response time why it has increased because data is too much now because data is too much so it takes a lot of time to traverse so that's why we are applying partitioning so I can do partitioning in two ways first can be I can partition vertically ok vertically what will happen in such partition that this information will go to some s1 node this information will go to some s2 server and this information will go to some s3 server vertical partitioning I can do this ok second is why I am doing horizontal partitioning like this I can do something like this that first from 1 to n student which is go to s1 node and second from n plus 1 to m student where it goes go to s2 node I can do this absolutely so this is partitioning simply you are dividing the data the data or table you have that you are storing some data on one node on one node some data you are storing on the other node now you will say what was happening in the replica in the clustering you are making copy of all the data and establishing a new server here you are dividing the data in two servers data is being divided ok big problem any big problem you see so you divide it into small parts and approach then the problem is solved we are trying to do something like this that you have a lot of data you have a lot of data why not I either divide horizontally or vertically ok I can do this this is called partitioning let's go to the notes let's read what is written ok partitioning is the technique used to divide stored data waste object into separate servers we have divided in separate servers due to this there is an increase in performance and controllability performance will increase how it happened let's see in a while ok partitioning is of two types vertical and horizontal ok so what we are doing in vertical dividing the column wise table so some columns will be stored in your server s1 and some tables will be stored in s2 server ok need to access different server to get complete data now suppose you have this table ok you have this table and this is the column you have first two columns in s1 server and the other two columns in s2 server now you need information of complete tuple so what you have to do you totally need this data so particularly if this is one ww s2 times from ks already this value we have seen in the later remain se in books and from there But in horizontal scaling you do nothing like this In horizontal scaling you do horizontal scaling That your roll number Or here we have taken ID From 1 to 25k All these are stored in S1 And from 25, 0, 0, 1 to 100k You have stored in S2 server So if you have divided your data horizontally In this case independent chunks of data are stored in different servers So you have stored independent chunks If you want information from 1 to 100k You will take it out from S1 server And if you want more than 25k students You will take it out from S2 server But when you take out from 1 to 100k You are taking out students from 1 to 100k So you are accessing only S1 Not S2 So S1 is independent of S2 So this is the only thing You can do two types of partition Vertical and horizontal When partition is applied We have discussed this When data becomes used That managing and dealing with the tedious task Data has become very big And more important than this Or better reason to apply Partitioning When the number of requests is so much That single database server is not able to Serve your request in a stipulated time So in this case what we do In this case we again partition things horizontally or vertically Ok Very good What is the advantage of partitioning Parallelism comes Ok How is parallelism improving in advantage Ok We will see that Suppose you have this table Ok And you have this first chunk You have put it in S1 And the second chunk you have put in S2 server Ok Now Now if you have requests coming from here When multiple requests are coming Ok So what will you do You will filter out these requests Ok You will filter out You will see Like we took an example Suppose from 1 id to 10000 id It is stored here And from 10000 to 10000 is stored here So you will see that Which server's corresponding requests you have If you have requests from 1 to 1000 So you will send these requests Suppose from 1 to 1000 id requests You will send those requests to S1 And you will send these requests to S2 So you have established a kind of parallelism Right Second Availability will increase Availability See All these works we are doing Of DB optimization All these increase availability We saw in the clustering Availability increases How is availability increasing here Suppose your S1 node is crashed Your S1 node is crashed Ok So the requests corresponding to S1 node That is, requests from 1 to 1000 id Which was the request of 10000 id That will not be able to be served But the rest will be served The rest will be served So some requests will not get your response Some requests will be neglected But some requests will be at least The whole system is not down at least Right Ok Performance will increase We were doing this Because we want to increase the performance Because the response time of the system will be reduced Because now it is less loaded S1 is a less loaded system S2 is also a less loaded system If all this information was in the same system Then it would have been a more loaded system It takes more time to process it And you see Your requests are also being divided Because your request is divided Requests from 1 to 10000 id are going to S1 Rest are going to S2 Because your request is divided So you have better performance You will get better performance There is a guarantee after this Similarly, the manageability will increase How will the manageability increase Suppose you have DBA DBA had to change something in the students from 1 to 10000 Ok So it has to change in S1 node only And it will be done quickly Similarly, if you want to change something in S2 Then it will be done in S2 So you are getting a kind of bird eye view That half of my data is here So if I want to work in this data Then I will work here only Half of my data is here If I want to work in this data Then I will work here only So in the bird eye view You can see that the manageability is increasing Ok Second is Reduce cost How is the cost reducing? If you would have done vertical scaling in the same node If you would have stored all the information in the same node Then what would you have done? As I said You would have increased the capacity of the system Increase CPU Increase hard disk Increase RAM That is costly In terms of If you bring one more CPU Ok If you bring one more CPU Which is of less capacity But it will work Because your request is divided ultimately Because all the requests will not go for S2 Some requests will come for S1 Because some requests will be up to 1000 number Ok So in this way You take these five advantages from partitioning Ok And when you partitioned all this What did you do? You divided your database into different servers Some data is here Some data is here But logically Is it the data of the student? Yes or no? You You had a table of students You have some information If you are doing horizontal partitioning Vertical partitioning Whatever You have stored some information Some information in one server Installed in the other server Stored So what happened with this? You have divided In two different servers But Your database is logically the same It is the student's table Similarly If it is a very big database If it is a university database If you have partitioned and stored things there So logically it is the same database So I am telling this This is a distributed database This database is distributed in different nodes But this is logically the same So what is its definition? Single logical database It is the same database Single logical database That is spread across multiple location servers Logically interconnected together By network So whenever you apply clustering, partitioning, sharding So ultimately You distribute the database Ok And what is its need? What is its need? Its need is Read the fifth point That the request has increased The data has increased Then we apply these things Then we apply database automation techniques So I hope You must have understood well Why we apply DB automation techniques And what techniques can be applied I can do horizontal partitioning I can do horizontal partitioning I can do vertical partitioning Ok I can apply clustering I can apply partitioning One more thing We have written here Sharding Now let's see what is this sharding If I talk about sharding So this is a horizontal partitioning Is the technique to apply Ok Let's go to the nodes Sharding is the technique to implement horizontal partitioning Is the technique to implement horizontal partitioning Or I can say It is simply an extension of horizontal partitioning Or I can say It is simply an extension of horizontal partitioning Ok Let's discuss it formally So the fundamental idea of sharding is that Sharding is the idea that Instead of having all the data set on the one instance It is the same thing Instead of keeping it on one instance We split it up And introduce a routing layer So that we can forward the request To the right instance That actually contains the data Ok There must be some confusion Let's understand it Now suppose you have the same student's data Ok So you have the same data So you have the same data So you have the same data So you have the same data So you have the same data So you have the same data So you have the same data Ok So you have the same data From 1 to 10k you have stored the row number in 1 s1 Similarly from 1 to 100k you have stored in s2 node Ok Now you have stored it What you have done is Horizontal partitioning That is when you have this table of student Student's table So you have stored some part here And the rest part you have stored here Ok So you have divided it tuple wise You have put the whole tuple in this So you have all the information of 1 to 100k row number Here Similarly all the information of 100k will be in s2 Ok So we have understood it properly Now you see carefully That s1 and s2 both are independent Now how are they independent That whenever your request is of 1 to 10k row number Then you can put it in the table And when you get the corresponding of s1 to 10k row number Then you can put it in s1 And when you get the other requests Then you can put it in s2 We have understood this We have discussed this a little while ago Ok But there is a problem in sharding As we have said Introduce a routing layer Because I want a routing layer I want a routing layer Why do we need a routing layer Let's understand this Suppose you have got any request Ok And now you have s1 shard This is called shard When you are doing sharding So s1 s2 s3 s4 So we call it shard This is a shard 1 This is a shard 2 Ok In shard 1 you have information from 1 to 10k row number And here information is stored from 10k to 100k Ok You have stored the row numbers So whenever you get a request So what you have to do You have to write a routing layer In your application layer Ok Routing layer That is, you have to write in your software Which will tell you that this request Which shard you have to send Is this request for s1 Or is this request for s2 So this logic is an additional capability I can say You have to do additional implementation Or you can say a lookup I have to put a lookup That brother This is an intermediate layer It will tell that this request Should I send it on s1 db instance Ok Or send it on s2 db instance Ok We understand this Whenever you apply sharding in this It is necessary for you Ok Let's see an example of this This is a simple example of this You have this This is an invoice table Ok This is an invoice table of amazon And what is in this table You have customer id Invoice id And creation You have done horizontal partitioning So you will see here This color is cream color This is going in shard 1 This is blue color This is shard 2 This is going in blue color So two shards of the database have been created Shard 1 and shard 2 Ok Now you have done horizontal partitioning So what is this Now look carefully The shard key in this Partitioning key I have made a custom id This is called shard key Partitioning key You can also call it On the basis of which key You have done Just say student On the basis of student id So see one One two and two Ok Here this is the table Invoice table This is the primary key Invoice id Ok But you can make something else about shard Partitioning key You can make something else So by partitioning this So this is your information It will be here This is your information It will be here Ok Simple to understand Ok So you will store this in s1 db shard This will be stored in s2 server Not server Here in sharding It is called shard Ok Nothing Everything is in name Very good Ok Now let's see one thing What are the pros and cons of sharding Ok You must be a little confused Sometimes If you talk normally In system design interviews Normally You will see People call partitioning and sharding the same That partitioning and sharding Are used in the same sense Ok Means We have read it by saying partitioning Vertical partitioning Horizontal partitioning People read it like this Sharding That vertical sharding Horizontal sharding So sharding and partitioning Both are Kind of synonyms Ok Although they are not synonyms But normally When you use in industry Both are used in the same terms That sharding You are doing partitioning Ok But normally By theory What happens Sharding Is a way of horizontal partitioning Ok I can say this Ok Let's read the pros and cons Pros and cons You know this Parallel increase Availability Manageability Cost will be less Ok All this we know So this technique To increase scalability You are scaling You are scaling out Ok If you have more data Then you are scaling Increasing ability You know this too Let's see the cons of sharding Let's see the cons of sharding First of all My complexity That is You are increasing complexity You are seeing Question is What is the location You are getting What to say In specific What is you Let me tell you What are the Surfin So you have to write an additional layer, I am saying that you have to write a routing layer and non-uniformity comes. What is non-uniformity? Suppose this was the table, you choose shard key or partition key in this way. You want the division to be uniform. Suppose if there are 6 rows here, then 3 rows go here and 3 rows go there. Suppose here invoice id is not partitioned, here customer id is partitioned. So it is possible that customer id 2, like it has ordered 2, suppose customer id 2 has ordered 1000. Now if you have ordered 1000, then you will see that in this portion, the number of customers will increase because corresponding to customer id 2, 1000 entries will be there. So due to this, the division of the two shards that you have divided will be non-uniform. Here the information will be more, here the information will be less. So the problem arises in this way that the non-uniformity that is introduced. The problem is defeated, you want that your division is uniform. Ok. So in this case, you increase the non-uniformity, it is introduced by chance. Now it is your responsibility to handle it. So what do you do? You reshard. You reshard your system from time to time. You reshard the partitioning key. So resharding is necessary. Now see the cones are very good. You introduced complexity. You have to implement a routing layer. You have to do it yourself. I will send a layer. I need a layer. Ok. Non-uniformity is introduced. And this thing is not well suited for analytical type of query. Now see carefully. It is not suitable for analytical type of query. And why is that? Suppose you have an amount here. Ok. I introduced one more amount. Amount. Now you need that. Because all your customers have ordered a certain amount. Suppose you have a request like this. That I want all the customers who have ordered 10 lakhs or 20 lakhs. Or 10 crore orders. Now what you have to do for this? If you have a single system, If you have a single node and you have this table stored. So what you do? Simply you run the aggregation function. So your SQL will pick up all your data from the same node. And it will give you a sigma. Right. You will get the answer. Now in this case, because you have sharded. So you have multiple nodes. You have data instance available. So the same data is sharded. Sharded. So what you have to do? Now what your layer will do? You have to write one more layer. Or your SQL database management system will handle this thing. It will go to the first node first. It will take out the sum of that. It will go to the second node. It will take out the sum of that. It will take out the sum of both. And it will give you the answer. Right. So this complexity is introduced. But you have to do something to get something. So if you have some pros, then some cons are also there. But sharding or partitioning is used a lot. It is a very good question for interview. The system you design, you will be asked a simple question. You have n number of requests. And if you have only one system, how will you handle it? You have to reduce the response time. So you will say I will do sharding. I will divide it into different nodes. I will write a layer. And what will that layer do? That layer will send which particular shard's corresponding request. This will reduce the overall response time. The data's manageability will increase. Your system will be scaled out. Scalability will increase. Availability will increase. Parallelism will increase. Manageability will increase. Performance will increase. And you will be saved from scale up. You will be saved from vertical scaling. Okay. Very good. I hope you have understood this technique of DB optimization. The techniques of DB optimization are very important. Clustering is very important. We call it as replica setup. Partitioning, sharding. All three are very important. Very good. So you should have a core idea. Whenever you are being asked about the system in the interview. Okay. So someone can ask you about this type of system design. That how will you optimize it? So these are some techniques. You can use them. And you can also use them. You can use them. You can use them. So these are some techniques. You can apply them and optimize your database. Okay. Now we have seen what is the shard key in this sharding. On what basis you are dividing your table in different nodes. Okay. It also has SQL queries. Table is a data definition language. You can google it on the internet. You will get it. You must have mastered SQL by now. I hope. Okay. Very good. My main work was to give you an idea. Okay. You can think. Why I am doing sharding. Why I am doing this. Okay. This was my idea for this video. Very good. See you in the next video. Till then. Good bye."

This is Lakshya. We have come to our database management system DBMS lecture number 2. And today we are going to discuss further and important topics about DBMS. In the previous lecture, we have studied what is data, what is information, what is database, what is DBMS actually, what is a simple software, and why we can't use file system directly. We have discussed about these things in the last lecture. If you haven't seen it, then do watch it because things are going to be more complex in this lecture. Complex as in, it will be a long lecture. We are going to discuss many things in it. So, first of all, you tell me that there is a concept called abstraction. Abstraction is such an important concept that it has changed the world of computer. That is, how we can design things. How we can think. We have changed this thing completely. Now, what is abstraction? Abstraction is that you simplify the system for the users. In what way? We expose those things in the system or those things are shown to the user in the system. To know what is important for them. What is the underlying complexity inside? How is the hardware working? How are things working inside? Those things are hidden. This is called abstraction. That is, the system hides certain details. After hiding those details, the interaction for the user becomes very easy and simplified. Let's take a very beautiful example from the real world. Car driving. What happens in car driving? You have to take care of accelerator, brakes and clutch. And on top of that, you have to take care of steering. If you want to take left, then it will go left. If you want to take right, then it will go right. Now, when you are doing left in steering, you are doing left scrolling. So, when you are doing left rotating, it is going left. How is your accelerator rotating inside? And how is the force being balanced on the tires that it goes left? You don't need to know all this. All this is known by the engineers. They know how it is designed. You pay attention to that. You don't pay attention to how it is working inside. How will the knob change inside when I change the gear? How will your rotatory mechanism be working inside? You don't pay attention to this. You just learn to drive that simple car. That's it. You get a license for this. So, this concept is called abstraction. The end user doesn't need to know everything. He should know some things. So that the use of that system can be simplified. Let's take one more example from the computer world. You have a software called Tally. Everyone must have heard about it. If you haven't heard about it, then I will tell you. This is basically a business software. Okay? This is a business software. And it is mostly used by the users of commerce. But the developers like me don't have commerce. They have understood everything and developed it. Now, when this software is made, it must have used a lot of data structures. The user who is sitting and clicking on things like add, delete, minus, plus, or some calculations, GST calculations, things like this, the user doesn't need to know about it. So, how is it calculated internally? The file that the user is saving, where and how is it being saved? Okay? When the file is being saved, what is the encoding, what is the encryption, is there any data compression? This has nothing to do with the user of Tally. He uses simple Tally and generates things from it. That's it. When things are exported in Tally, suppose you exported a balance sheet, and exported it in PDF. Okay? If you don't understand the example of Tally, then we can take one more example. You take Excel. Okay? In Excel, when you export Excel in PDF, you see two buttons. Export to PDF. It is exported in PDF. Now, how is your Excel document being converted in PDF? Because Excel is a different format, PDF is a different format. How is the conversion happening? You don't have to take that into account. Okay? So, this is called abstraction. The system hides from you the underlying complexity. So, the same thing, the same abstraction thing, same, your DBMS also applies. Okay? Abstraction is also applied in DBMS. Let's see how it happens. Hard work and success goes hand in hand. That means if you put effort, then the opportunity also comes. The same story is of Navneet Reddy, who lives in a small village in Hyderabad. Navneet was very interested in technology from the beginning. He used to see how the computer works. And he was very interested in small things. He has a very humble background. And his father is also a farmer. Just around this time, he came to know about Relevel. He gave a test. And within 15 days, he took a job in his favorite company. 200 plus companies hire from Relevel. And for all of them, you are eligible from anywhere in India. If you are also targeting a good company, cracking its package, 10 to 15 lakhs per annum package, then you can use Relevel through a free test. And in 15 days, you can grab your dream job. Relevel has provided jobs worth 30 crores so far. Last month also 36 lakhs worth of jobs have been delivered daily. And you will see a lot of candidates in your surrounding locality across India. A few days ago, Relevel has introduced 5 new tests. Project Associate, Graphic Design, Finance, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.

If you are interested, you can apply there. There is no fee. All tests are free for you. If you want to start your career from the top companies in India, like Navneet, or if you want to grow your career in the same way, Relevel is the best platform for you. You don't need any degree, nor any experience. You just need skills. So, go check it out today in the description. Thank you. Now, DBMS also has a major purpose. It provides an abstract view of data to the user. How data is stored, how it is maintained, in which data structures, by hashing, in which bits and bytes, in which table form, how it is kept, it doesn't matter to the user. The user should see the data. So, DBMS has a purpose to provide an abstract view. Here, the term view, keep the view in your mind. We will go into more detail about it. If you are a little confused, then hold on for a while. We will understand later. Your DBMS is not only for developers, but also for many end users. So, you can use it for many other things. You can use it for many other things. You can use it for many other things. You can use it for many other things. You can use it for many other things. You can use it for many other things. It is the database. Simply, your school's administration is checking the number of students enrolled this year. This type of thing. It is checking, how the data is stored inside. How is the data coming out? From which server is it coming? You don't need to know about all these things about your administration. about your administration. You don't need to know about all these things. So, data abstraction is applied here too. Let's see how it is applied and the purpose of that. Let's see. What is your main purpose? Let me tell you. What is your main purpose? Let me tell you. Now let's see how abstraction is applied. Let's see the purpose of this. Let's take the purpose as simple as this. Let's assume that this is your database. This is your database. Let's call it DB. And let me make it like this. This is your DBMS. Okay. To access this database, there are multiple users. Let's assume that there is one user. Okay. There is user 2. There is user 3. There are many users like this. Okay. So, every user has to provide a different view of the data. Why do we have to provide it? Let's understand that first. Now take an example. You have Amazon. Okay. You have Amazon. It is such a big company. Okay. There are many departments in the company. And your Amazon has stored the data of the customers. Now which data of the customers have you stored? Okay. Your customer's name is stored. Okay. Address is stored. Phone number is stored. Okay. Customer's likings are stored. Assume liking, disliking. Okay. Which credit card does the customer use the most is stored. Okay. Which debit card uses the most is stored. Okay. Which UPI address uses the most is stored. Okay. The number of times you are using the phone number is also stored. Okay. Many things like that are stored in this. Okay. Let's assume. There will be a lot of things like and dislike like customer reviews. How many products have you bought so far. Okay. Products. Board. We put it like this. Very good. Okay. One more important thing that I forgot in it is the age. And tell me one thing, that all this customer's data is stored in your DB. Suppose. Okay. And suppose you have a department. It is a logistics department. And suppose your department is a business department. Suppose your department is a business department. There is a company called S-Bank. I have a company called S-Bank. I have a company called S-Bank. This is the department of customer service center. And this is also a department. Let's forget it. We will use it from two examples. Now, see the data of Amazon is stored in one place in this DB. So, I have stored the data in one place. But its end users are different. One is a logistic department user and the other is a customer service center user. So, because of different users, we don't want to give all the information of the customer to each department. Will we want this? No, we won't. Reason being, logistic department should not give name, phone number, address, like and dislike, age, credit card details, UPI details, product of which board, what product is bought before, like and dislike. This is not important and should not be given. We want logistic department to be logistic. Logistics information should be given. Customer service department should only show the important things related to customer service. So, for this, the view of the database, the view, listen to the word carefully. For this, the view of the database or the view of the data is only this. For that, it is only this. This, this and address. Okay. So, these three things are your view for the logistic department. Okay. For this, customer service department needs only one thing apart from these three things. That he has ordered five products before. Okay. Maybe your product is bad or you have to refund it or you have to replace it. So, after that, there should be information about what you ordered last. So, the information of the products which you ordered should also be on it. So, look carefully. For customer service department, your view of the data is shown like this. Okay. And for logistic department, your view of the data is shown like this only. So, you can see how beautifully we have used abstraction to hide things. Logistics department only needs information related to logistics department. It doesn't mean which credit card is being used, whether it uses UPI or not, how was the payment done. It doesn't mean anything. Similarly, customer service center should have information related to product. So, the ultimate goal of providing abstraction in your database management system is that multiple users are accessing the same data but we want them to have a personalized view. Let's go to notes and understand it carefully. View of data. Major purpose of TBM is to provide abstract view of data. Why? So that system can hide certain details like how data is stored, how it is maintained. We don't want to know all this. End user doesn't care. Now, let's take an example. What does logistic department mean? Name is stored in string. It means whether it is encrypted or not. It doesn't matter. It just needs a name. It just needs to deliver. It just needs to send trucks, delivery boys at home. So, the main objective of 3 level architecture is to enable multiple users to access the same data with personalized view while storing the underlined data once. Underlined data once means that DB is stored in one place only. But, for every department, your view is different. It sees the data differently. This department sees only these three things. It sees this thing with these three things. So, this is your view. So, we have explained the end goal of abstraction. This was the end goal. This was its main objective. But, how is this abstraction being achieved? For that, you use 3 schema architecture. What is 3 schema architecture? We divide your DBMS into three abstract levels. Okay? So that it can provide abstraction. Which are those three levels? Let's understand it. First, let's understand what schema is. Schema. Okay? There was a lot of confusion regarding this word when I was studying DBMS in my college time. Schema is nothing. Schema is your design. Okay? We can replace schema word with design. Design means how this thing looks, how it is made, this type of things. Okay? You will understand everything if you read further. Let's wait a little. First of all, what I do is that I provide an abstraction of physical level in the database. What is physical level abstraction? I call it internal level abstraction. This is the lowest level abstraction. And this physical level provides how the data is actually stored. Okay? For example, in Facebook, there is a profile picture. Suppose we have stored profile picture in the database. So, it is stored in the database. You can see that the picture is stored. But, actually, on the physical level, in the disk, in the SSD, how it is stored, describing about that is what your physical level abstraction tells you. Physical level of your database, or database, sorry, database manual system, physical level tells you how the data is stored. So, what is picture? Picture. You have collection of bytes. Ultimately, what are bytes? They are pixels. So, it is possible that I will imagine these pixels. Suppose, in the database, suppose, it is 100x100. So, I will not store it like this. I will put some compression in it. What will happen after putting compression? Suppose, I have put run length encoding. Run length encoding. What is run length encoding? You will understand it by Google once. Okay? I have put run length encoding. So, suppose, the picture was of 1MB earlier. After putting run length encoding, suppose, it became 50 KB. Just suppose. So, in this way, I have defined that I will compress images with run length encoding and store them. Okay? So, this is what you have done. What do you want to tell on physical level? In physical level, we tell the lowest level of abstraction that how the data is stored. And how the data is stored in physical level? We tell this with physical schema. It has physical schema which describes physical storage structure of DB. What is physical schema? Put a blueprint. Put a paper. It is a blueprint. Like, you make a house. Before making a house, you make a map of the whole architecture. You make a map that here will be a bedroom, here will be this, here will be a gallery, here will be stairs. Okay? So, this is your blueprint. It is not actual. So, physical schema is also a blueprint. It is telling that basically, you will store the image in this way. Okay? For a storage location, which data compression will you put? Okay? Which encryption will you put? Okay? Where will you store? Okay? You will store in blocks. Okay? You will store in blocks. Okay? You will store in blocks. Okay? You will store in big blocks. You will store in small blocks. How will you store? Will you put hashing? Will you not put? Such things are told by your physical schema. So, what is physical schema? It is a blueprint which is telling that data on physical level, on disk level, how to store? In which data structure to store? What is its goal? That we should store such algorithm or data in such way that your data is fast accessible. Okay? It is not like that. Like, we take an example in this. So, we will take an example in this. Okay? Now, you have put compression here. Okay? Now, you have put compression such a technique which is very costly to decompress. Okay? CPU computation is very costly to decompress. So, I would say that your data access is not fast. Okay? So, I want data access to be ultimately fast. Okay? I should use such data structures which can access data fast. Okay? I may make binary tree, make red-black tree or make an NRE tree and store data in tree form so that I can search it or store data in tries if there is any dictionary type. So, in this way, at the physical level, we tell that how to store data in risk. It is a simple thing. Now, let's talk about your logical level. What is logical level? I call it conceptual level. You must be understanding a little. Logically means how data is logically visible. Okay? That means, as I said that data is stored in the form of bits and bytes. Okay? You have stored data of student. So, you have stored the name in the form of strings. In one place, in one location, you have stored the name in the form of strings. Okay? In your disk. But, when I talk about logical level, it means how data is logically visible. So, conceptual level tells that what data is stored? So, you have stored data. Data is stored in the form of bits and bytes. So, what data is there? It is the data of employee. It is the data of student. So, if it is the data of student, then how does it look like? We tell this type of things and tell the relationship in that data. There will be some confusion in that data. Let's understand this once. Conceptual level. There are 2-3 things in conceptual level. First of all, I think that I want to store the data of student. Okay? So, what will be there in the student? His name will be there. Okay? Suppose, phone number will be there. College students. Address will be there. Okay? Suppose, your student's name will be there. Okay? And, you have stored the data of student. So, your batch number will be there. Something like that. Okay? Suppose, this is the data of student. Let's talk about physical level. Physical level. What does it mean? That, brother, this name of yours, Okay? How is it stored on physical level? Now, there must be one student. There are many students. So, I tell that, brother, this is your file. Okay? I put name in it. Okay? After that, I put address. Then, I put batch number. After these four entries, after these four entries, next, the name which I will put again, the name which I will put again, this will be the name of second student. The name of second student. Such batch number. So, you have stored such things in the file. So, this is the physical level. If I pick up and see the file, you will open this file by double clicking, then what will you see? You will see, it is written as RAM 8, 8123, WZ 526, batch number 2019, something like this. So, if I tell you that this is not the data of student, okay? Then, you will say that some names are written in the store of bits and bytes. So, your brain is able to read that this is the name. Suppose, name is XYZ, username is 0196. So, you will say that data is stored, I don't know what data it is. You won't be able to tell by looking at the file. So, physical level, we are talking about this. So, you have to store data. Okay? After 4 commas, the next name will be of your second student. He doesn't know this. He just knows that something is written in the data. Your file is made. That's all. Now, you have to convert this file in some table of this type. Name, phone number, address, batch number, first, second, third, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth. And, you can see that this is student's data. So, when you transform this file from physical level to logical level, then your data will be like this. Here, there is some entry, XYZ. Phone number, address, batch number, as you see here, it is written here. Phone number, address, batch number, and student's data. And, what do you say logically? That the student's data has four attributes. What are those attributes? Name, phone number, address, and batch. But, you were not able to say this at the physical level. At the physical level, you can think that this is stored as a file. You don't know what student is. But, what did you do? You have transformed this from physical level to logical level. And, you saw and told that this is student. So, I am saying this physical level to logical level mapping. So, how does this mapping happen? This mapping happens from your logical schema. Okay? Your new term has come. Logical schema. I am saying conceptual schema. So, as it is written here, conceptual schema describes the design of the data at the conceptual level. Conceptual means how the data looks logically. Okay? Which data is stored? Is the data of the student stored? Okay? What is the relationship in that data? When I will write these four together, then I will be able to say that I have one student and I have one student. So, I will be able to say that I have one student and I have one student. So, this is the full information of the student. Okay? Similarly, let's assume that you have a student. Along with the student, we have a table of course. You have some data stored even after doing the course. What does that course do? In the course, you have been told that what is the ID of the course? Okay? What is the name of the course? Okay? And what is the duration? By doing this, and you have said that every student will have to enroll in some or the other in every semester in five courses. So, the student ticket of your student will be the same as the student ticket of your student. So, in your student database, there will be a thing called course ID. Right? So, now I can say that I have two different data tables. Basically, there are two different tables. One is student and the other is related. How is it related? There is a relationship between them. What is that relationship? That is, the student applies in the courses. Or I can say that courses are applied by student. So, see this word. Courses are applied by student. So, this is telling a relationship between them. So, in your database, the data stored in that database, at the physical level, at the physical level, your student's data will also be stored. There will be another file in which your course's data will also be stored. Right? So, now at the physical level, you cannot tell whether it is a course or a student or how it is related to each other. But, at the conceptual level, at the logical level, you tell that there are four or five entries in the course. So, you can see that there are three entries in the course. And there is a relationship between the student and the course that the student applies for the course. Right? So, we have done the same thing here that which data is stored and what is the relationship between the data and some other data. Because, at the physical level, this data and the data of your course will be the same. How? How will it be the same? Listen carefully. Name. There is a name here too. There is a name here too. I can see both the strings at the physical level. There is a phone number here. There is a course ID here. Both are integers. I can see both integers at the physical level. Right? So, things like this are told here. And at the logical level, what do you tell? We don't talk about the structure of the physical level. It is written that user at the logical level does not need to aware about the physical structure. Physical structure means that basically this information is stored here. I don't need to know about it at the logical level. We are talking about this here that the internal level which I am talking about at the physical level and the conceptual level which is the user at the conceptual level right? It has nothing to do with how the data is stored. Data should be retrieved and come up to it. It will use conceptual design and convert it to the table. It will convert it to the table. Right? So, it will be a little confusing but understand carefully that basically in the internal level data is stored as bits and bytes. Right? From the internal level there is a mapping at the conceptual level. Right? It is a mapping that you pick up the file and do some processing and after processing you convert it to the student table. Right? And at the logical level we describe that what is the relation between data and the person at the logical level does not know how the data is stored. Right? What is the big advantage of this? The big advantage of this is physical data independence. What does it mean? If you change the physical schema then logically there is no difference in the application. Right? Let's understand how it is. What was your level? This was your logical level. Right? I will write it. This is your logical level. Now, in this logical level what does the meaning of physical data independence mean? If you have stored this file you thought that the file is stored in disk then why not store it in SSD so that it can be accessed fast. So, you can see that the file is stored in disk and you can see that the file is accessed fast. So, if you have converted this file and stored it in SSD then also the user who is sitting at the logical level does not care about this. Right? The meaning of logical level is that what is the data stored and what is the relation to this? There is no meaning in talking about how it is stored. There is no tension. This thing will be handled at your physical level and if there is any change at the physical level then there will be no difference at the logical level. How? Just like the mapping that was going on from the physical level to the logical level your schema will define the new mapping right? New mapping that first the mapping was done like this and now we have to do mapping again in some other way SSD to this logical level. Right? And now the name is stored like this name, phone number, address, batch number. Now, you can pick up the name and store all the names in a separate file. So, you can make four different files. Right? And now how will the physical level to logical level be mapped? The first string of the first file will be the name of the student. Right? The first integer of the second file will be the phone number. The first string of the third file will be the address. The first integer of the fourth file will be the batch. Right? So, the student will look like this. The student still has the name, phone number, and address batch. The first one also had the name, phone number, and address batch. So, it's simple. Your logical level but which data is stored and the relationship of the data is not talked about. Right? What is its goal? Easy to use. What is the goal of your physical level? You have to define how to store data so that its value is not too high. Now, we will talk about view level. What is view level? It is called highest level of abstraction. The person sitting on the view level is the end user. It doesn't have any meaning about conceptual, internal, physical, DB, it doesn't have any meaning. It is sitting at the top. It is the highest level of abstraction. It is used by the end user. It has a view schema. Right? It has a view schema. It is the database part that is particular user group is interested and hiding the remaining database from the group. That is, let's understand it with an example. We understand it with this example. Right? As we talked about, in this, in Amazon DB, for your logistic, customer data looks different. For your customer service department, it looks different. So, this is what is happening. If I talk about logistic, it is the logistic part. So, what is the logistic department's view schema? What is the view design? It is something like this. Name, address and phone number. This is the logistic department's view schema. And the customer service department's name and address and phone number. And, the product board. So, this is the logistic department's view schema. So, this is the logistic department's view schema. And, the logistic department's view schema is that they will get name, address and phone number and phone number. So, this is the logistic department's view schema. So, this is the logistic department's view schema. And, the logistic department's view schema is that they will get the details of the customer service department, the logistic department, and the logistic department. So, they will get the important details. So, the view schema is not related to the data. So, at the end, we will talk about the view of the customer. So, the view of the customer is the view of the customer. So, the view of the customer is the view of the customer. So, what aulla a the there, So, this is called view of data. Now, let's move ahead. I hope you understood something. What is an instance? DB instance. Let's call it instance of DB. What is an instance? Suppose you were storing the data of a student. And how was it looking? This is the schema of your student. At the logical level, student looks like this. You don't care about the physical level. At the logical level, student looks like this. So, when student looks like this, Suppose you just made a student database. Now, the first student comes. Suppose you just opened a new school. So, your first student comes and he has enrolled his name. Your first student has enrolled. Now, the second student comes. You enrolled him. Very good. Now, when you have enrolled, Now, when you have enrolled, Now, someone asks you, What information is stored in the student database? Suppose, at this particular time, Suppose, it is 12 in the morning. So, at this time, how is your DB looking? So, now you will say that, In DB, there are two rows. That is, there are two data points. OK. And those two data points are of XYZ student and ABC student. So, this means that, Which information is stored in a table, at a particular point of time, at the time when it will be asked. I call it as instance of data wise. OK. Now, it may be that, Next day at 12 o'clock. OK. Next day at 12 o'clock, More students have enrolled in it. OK. So, what I will say to the database instance at 12 o'clock next day, That there are three students here. OK. And, Suppose, after one year, I say, What DB instance is running in it? It may be that thousands of students have enrolled in it. So, at a particular point of time, How many data points are stored in it, in the table? OK. What information is stored in the database? I call it as database instance. OK. Table is the same. But, data is being filled in it. It may be that some students, Suppose, They withdraw their name from here. If the name is withdrawn, After withdrawing, I will say, What is the database instance? You say that two students are stored. And, these are particular students. Let's go to notes once. The collection of information stored in the DB at a particular moment is called instance of database. OK. It is not a big thing. Now, we have read about database schema. That overall design, We call design as database schema. OK. Schema is called as design. We have read three types of schema. First, physical level schema. Second, logical level schema. Third, view level schema. View level schema is very multiple. As we have seen in the case of customer, Logistics was different. Your customer service was different. I call it as sub schema. So, there are three types of schemas. OK. Now, normally, The term schema, The normal schema term, Tell me DB schema, DB schema, Normally, the term used in schema, It is called as logical level. That is, logical level schema, Logical level schema, Not the schema of DB, It is called as simple database schema. OK. So, this is basically normal nomenclature. This is the jargon used. That simple DB schema, I use it for logical level schema. OK. So, as we have talked, The schema, How is the structural data described, It is told. Like here, its schema is, How is the design of the student? Name, address and batch are seen. OK. Schema does not change usually. It does not change very fast. Things can change at physical level. I am storing the data, Change it. Data is only simple bits and bytes. But, student will look like this. OK. So, this is your schema. Now, what are the things in schema? Which I am talking about DB schema. DB schema, Which is actually a logical schema. What are the things stored in it? First of all, attributes. Attributes of table. Like here, There is a table of student. OK. So, what are the attributes in the schema of student? What are the attributes of student? How can we describe a student? We can describe. I want name, I want phone number, I want address, I want batch. If there are four things, Then I can define student. OK. So, attributes are said like this. Attributes are same. Name is an attribute. Phone number is an attribute. Address is an attribute. Second, In this, There are consistency constraints. Consistency constraints means, That your name, Name, Name cannot be null. That means, No student can be without name. So, this is consistency constraint. OK. No student can be without address. No student can be without phone number. OK. So, this is consistency constraint. One thing we haven't added in it. Which we will add later. That is your student ID. Why student ID? To uniquely identify a student. OK. So, Your student ID should be in it. Uniquely identify should also be done. That is, I call the attribute of the student ID as primary. OK. We will read about it in detail later. Now, Just listen. That in your normal table, To uniquely identify any data point, Which attribute is used, I call it as primary. So, It should be of primary. And, Consistency constraint also says that, Primary should not be null. If primary is null, Then how will I define a student? How will I identify a student? OK. So, Such things are there in schema. Third thing in schema is, That is, Rectangular. So, Rectangular is a variable. So, Rectangular is a variable. So, Rectangular is switches in general in every state. See here, So, Now, You should be aware about the Basis case. So, Here is the key factor. If maybe your depression is certain, Of course, Then it should not be less than 1000 times verify. Let me \ubc18\ubcf5 massacre eastern or western. It is used not to give a test result. 45% over 500 is divided by \u0441\u0442. Can remove 600, If not\u044f\u0442\u044c 500 it should be 36. All these facts were analyzed. So, It is almost 100 times. But, There is a tip point of this article, Its level of fiscality is 25. 123\u54c7 Logical schema is the most important. How is it important? I will make applications on behalf of the course schema of the student. Suppose you have a database of the student and you are making an application in which you have to use the information of the student. When you will make an application, you will define the class of the student. It has the members of the class. Suppose you have defined the class of the student in your host application. Suppose you are making an application in which students get a loan. Suppose you are making an application for banks in which students get a loan. When you will use the database of students, you will define the student's class in your app. You will keep the string name in it, and address. You will have phone number like this. student ID, etc. You have to keep these. That's why we are saying here that your logical schema most affect application programs. Whatever programs you want to make, you will make by looking at the logical schema. For example, the structure you have made to store the information of the student in your program, you have not put the name in it. So this is not right. So whatever application you write, you will write by looking at the logical schema. Let's move ahead. Now you have understood what is the logical schema? What are the things that are useful at the logical level? What is the logical level? At the logical level, what is your data stored? How is the data visible? What is your relationship between data? How does the student schema look? What is the name in it? But you also need a way. You are making an application. You have thought that you will make a banking system. So in the banking system, when you will make a database of banking, you want to make a design that logically how will my data look like? These are the customers of my bank. This is the information of my debit card. This is the information of your employees. I want to store all this. What relationship will be established between them? How will my data be figured out logically? To tell that, I use data models. Okay? Data models. How did this become big? Okay? Okay? So what are data models? Let's see. Provides a way to describe the design of DB. What will be the design at the logical level? How will the student look? What will be the relationship between the student and the course? For example, I took the example of banking application. In banking, the information of employees and payroll is there. The information of employees and payroll. At what level which payroll is available. How is all that information related to you? How will you store the information? How will you make the design at the logical level? That provides a view. That provides a way. Data model. So underlying the structure of DB is data model. Okay? The structure of the whole database. The structure of the whole database. Okay? How you were making the banking. How your employees are related to payroll. How your customer is related to debit card information. Or credit card information. Okay? If a customer makes a transaction, then how is that transaction related to the customer? Or the customer has a separate table. So how will you be related to them? The work of describing all this is the data model. Okay? You may be a little confused. In the next class, we will study about data models. Then everything will be clear to you. So what is the data model? Collection of conceptual tools for describing the data. What is data? Like how we are describing the data of the student. A student is described by these five things. Then you get data relationships. What is the relation in data? What was the relation between the course and the student? Data Semantics. What is the meaning of data? Consistency Constraint. What is the Consistency Constraint? The way you want your bank account to be not below 1000 rupees. Your bank account. The statement of your bank. Your bank account will be stored in DB somewhere. So you have put a constraint. That your bank balance should not go below 1000 rupees. Okay? This is your Consistency Constraint. What are the data models? First of all, your data is a data model. Okay? Relational model. Object Oriented Model. Object Relational Model. What is the object Relational Model? It is a mix of object oriented model and relational model. Okay? What is the ER model? Relational model? We are going to study this in detail in the coming class. So don't worry. All these things. Now understand that data model is useful to define data logically. How to describe data logically. You will need a data model. Very good. Now you will see, in this class, we have discussed conceptually, logically, conceptually, DB schema. I call it conceptual schema and also call it logical schema. So you have to see this carefully. The concept of data model is based on this. Okay? Now let's learn about database languages. Database language consists of two types of language. You have created a database management system. Okay? You have created D, P, M, S. To use this, you have to use some language. Like I am telling you, you write programs in computer. So you write in some language. And why do you write in that language? Because your compiler understands that language. And to understand that, it basically transforms it in machine code. It converts it. And that machine code is your processor which can understand directly. Okay? So, you have to use this language. So, using this same concept, you have to use DBMS. Okay? To interact with this, you need a language. To interact with DBMS, you need a language. There are two types of language. First, you have to define a schema in database. Okay? First, you have to define a schema at the logical level. What is that? It is a student. Okay? It has a student ID, an attribute, an address, a phone number, etc. So, you have told us what is schema of a student. What is the design of a student? So, the language which tells us how to define schema, I call it DDL. Data Definition Language. Language to define data. Okay? It is a simple data definition language to specify a database schema. Now, you have defined the schema of a student. How is the schema of a student? Student ID, name, address, phone number, etc. Let's assume these four things. So, you have made a table of a schema. You have made a table. After making a table, you have to enter data in it. You have to enter data. You have to insert data. Okay? You may have to delete data after some students have left. Okay? If the address of a student has changed, you have to update the address of that particular student. You have updated the address. And you have to see this. You need data retrieval. What does retrieval mean? The principal comes and says that the data is retrieved from the address of the student. The principal comes and asks the list of students who live in this particular pin code. The principal comes and asks. So, for that, you have to do data retrieval. Now, we are assuming that these four things are stored in the student. Now, we are talking simply. So, you want retrieval in the address of the student who lives in a particular address. You need data retrieval mechanism for that. So, the data retrieval mechanism provides that language. I call that language data manipulation language. Data manipulation language. Data manipulation language. What is DML? DML is data manipulation language. As we have discussed, we have to retrieve information, insert information, delete, update, and so on. Now, you see that when we define the database schema, we define it. As we have discussed, we tell the attributes. We also tell the consistency constraints. Your student ID should not be null. Your name should not be null. Your phone number should be 10 digits. These are the consistency constraints. There should not be any wrong information stored. The database should not be corrupted. We need a consistent, good database which looks good after every update. So, when you define DDL, that is, you define a database schema using DDL, we specify consistency constraints which we check whenever there is any entry, deletion, or any type of modification in the database. It is checked whether that thing is correct or not. If a student comes and gives a mobile number of 5 digits, then the student will not be able to enter. The error will be there. Now, practically, DDL and DML are not two different languages. One is C++, one is Java, one is Python, one is Java. Both of these features are provided in the same language. One is provided in DB language. A very nice example of this is SQL. SQL language provides both methods. You also have to know the mechanism of DDL, how to define the database, how to manipulate it, how to delete it, how to do it. For example, here you have a lot of data stored. First, second, third. If someone wants to delete it, how will I delete this entry? This type of thing is provided by a single language. Its example is Structured Query Language, SQL. Whatever work it is, to define your database schema and to use DML, to modify the data, to tell something, these are called queries. Query language is a part of DML to specify statement requesting the retrieval of information. That is, your DB language, because we have said that both are incorporated in single language. DB language has a part of query mechanism. When you write a query, database management system, that is, DB is sent to database management system. Then it runs that query, and it provides you the result by taking out information from database. Let's see a simple example. Let's see example of D D L. So, this is your DB language. DB language has two parts. Defining your database schema and data manipulation language. We have taken an example that you have to make a student table. This is an example of SQL. We will read about SQL in detail. Now I want to explain that how query language looks like. So, this is a query. Create table student. Student will be an integer. Name will be where care. Where care string. Address will be where care. Its limit is 50, 90. Consistency constraint is given. Name should not be more than 50 letters. Phone number should be int. All consistency is constrained. In DML data, we are taking an example in which we are retrieving data. How can we list data? Select. I have taken a stick. This stick is used to define all. I want everything. From student. So, student is your DB schema. Corresponding to this, whatever data is there, list all the data points. So, this is what this query is. So, this is your query language. So, you must have understood. We will discuss about this later. Don't worry. So, what is the big thing? If you have written any application, then how will it access database? Now, what is the big thing in this? Big thing is that the application you have written, suppose you have written in javascript, in C, C++, in python. These are called host languages. But your database, DML system understands SQL. It understands your database language. We are taking SQL as an example. So, if it understands SQL, and you have written your function, suppose it is written in javascript, or written in java, then how will it interact? How will it interact? Because there is a wall of languages between them. This is written in JS, this is in SQL. So, how will JS communicate with SQL? Here, whenever communication comes between two different entities, then we talk about interface. Ok? Interface means two incompatible things. Javascript cannot understand SQL, SQL cannot understand JavaScript. So, we write a new interface, a new program, an application program interface, an API, which will convert any statement of JavaScript to SQL statement. Ok? Or I can say that I will write SQL statement in JavaScript and will make some package and send it here. Ok? Let's understand how to do it. So, what happens is that your APIs, in JavaScript, like in Java, your API is JDBC. I call it Java Database Connectivity. I call it Java Database Connectivity. Similarly, there is ODBC. This is CC++. This was made by Microsoft. So, basically, ODBC is an API. Your application program is a package. Like we import a package in Java. Similarly, there will be an include file. I will use that to communicate with database. Ok? You must be confused. Let's take this as a simple example. I had a personal project and I used this thing. Let me show you. This is a real world project. And this is an application. This is an application written in Java. And in Java, this is an application of server side. Server is your front end, back end. Now, look at the back end. Look carefully. In Spring Boot, you will see JDBC. Java Database Connectivity. Ok? The database we made in this project was made in SQL. Structure is written in a different language. And what does SQL understand? SQL understands such queries. It understands such queries. So, what we did? Look at this. All these are written in Java. Look carefully. Look carefully. Here you will see Insert into candidate After that, your name, phone number. All these are written in SQL. After writing this SQL, we have made a template in the form of a string and sent it here. We have written an update. So, using JDBC, this is an interface, we are able to communicate with SQL. That is, with the database. With the database, JDBC is working like a layer. And I am able to communicate here. And then the communication reaches the database. So, I retrieve it from here. Ok? So, some such things work. So, basically, if I want to communicate with host language, with DBMS system, then I use JDBC in Java. I use ODBC in Java. This is important from your interview perspective. You should know that you have written an application in your host language. So, how will you communicate with SQL? Very good. So, this is an example from Realworld. This is a simple query. Whose query? SQL's query. So, what I am doing? This is my Java application. I am using JDBC. So, in this data structure, I am writing the query of SQL and through JDBC, I am sending it to SQL server. SQL server is DBMS. Right? Now, what does JDBC do? It transforms the SQL query I have sent in the packet to actual SQL query. To actual SQL query. And then transforms it into JDBC. So, when SQL server replies, it takes JDBC from the SQL query and converts it into Java's data structure. Then Java gets the data. So, this is the work of interface. Very good. Now, let's move ahead. Let's understand what is database administrator. We have just read that the logical level, the logical schema is the most important thing. What is the relation between data and stored data? So, we need a person, who I call database administrator. What does that person do? He has central control over both data, data schema and the programs that are accessing data. As we have read, there is a database management system and many programs are accessing it. Let's take an example. The data of Aadhar, he is using many departments. He is using income department, EPF department, Home Minister's department. So, many departments are using same database. Each department has different view. So, which programs and APIs are accessing that data? And what is that data? The central control of that database is with DBA. So, let me say that this is your whole DBMs system. Here, DBA is there. So, here is a person who has all the control. What is the control? He knows what is data. He knows which APIs are accessing the data. He is doing EPFO, Home Ministry is accessing Aadhar's data. So, DBA is a person who has central control of the whole database. What are its functions? It works as schema definition. DBA works at logical level. DBA works at DBA level. And who works at view level? End user works at DBA level. And who works at this level? At this level, DBA works at this level. But mostly DBA works at this level. This is your internal storage. How you have stored in disk. Physical schema. So, let's see here. If I discuss its functions, then what will happen in student's schema? What attributes will be there? This is the work of DBA. How will be your storage structure? How will things look at physical level? All these are its work. Schema and physical organization modification. That means, if any change in any schema, any change in physical schema, then who is responsible for this? If your logical schema has changed, then who is responsible for this? Logical schema change as in, the student's schema, which we stored in Charpa Information, which is the committee of the school. It says that along with student, we should store information of Aadhar Card. So, what will happen in storing information of Aadhar Card? In your student's DBA, you have to add one more column, one more attribute of Aadhar Card. You have to add attribute of Aadhar Card. So, this is your whole schema has changed. Right? You have changed the schema, added new attribute. So, accordingly, you have to change the file, physical organization, which is the student's dependency, connection with the course, connection with the student, relation with the professor's data. There should be some changes in that. So, this whole cone is handled by DBA. Authorization control. Right? On which data, which will be accessed? Database, as we saw in the case of Amazon, a lot of data is stored. So, logically, which data should be given to the logistic department? Which is the data, which is restricted data, which can be accessed by some particular one or two people with some key. So, what to show to the authorization control? This whole control is done by DBA. And after that, your final routine maintenance. Database's maintenance. Your database should be periodically backed up. It is not like that one instance of the database is kept. It is possible that you have made a database copy in multiple servers. Because if one database server is lost, then in that case, your entire database will be deleted. You can't afford that. So, you have to collect the data over the period of multiple years. Security patches. Now, as you saw recently, many vulnerabilities come in the application. That hackers can access it. Adhar's database can be accessed. The data of NIC, National Informatics Center, hackers can access its data in the dark web. So, the security patches that come in that way, the work of applying them is also of DBA. Right? You have to see, which security patches have come in the system. So that your hacking cannot happen. And there are some upgrades in the system. It can be at the physical level. You may have upgraded it. You may have changed the design. You may have changed the physical schema. So that I can access the data faster. All these things are handled by DBA. DBA is asked in your interview. What are the functions of DBA? Who is DBA? DBA works at your logical level mostly. And you should remember all these things. So, let's talk about DBA. DBA is an application architecture. When you are creating an application which uses a database. For example, you are creating an application of weather data. It shows the weather. So, you have a database in which you store all the weather of every place. You have created its database. So, how will its architecture be? How will you divide it? How will the data be seen? How will your application communicate with the database? Let's discuss about it. So, DBA is an application architecture. Let's talk about it. So, let's understand some terms. You have two terms. First is client machine. Second is server machine. What is client machine? Where the end user is working. Okay. Suppose, you open YouTube at your home. So, in YouTube, you can see the data of the data of the data of the data. So, you can see the data of the data. So, you can see the data of the data from the database from the database. Right? So, what you can see is client machine. On the client machine, a remote DB user is sitting. And, you have another server machine. On the server machine, actual DB system is running. The database system is running on your server. So, these two machines are there. You have to understand this. So, how to arrange these two machines? Because, when you are making an application, your database, DBMS system, DBMS server, and client machine are there. This is how DBMS application architecture is defined. This is how DBMS application architecture is defined. There must be some confusion. Let's understand the first architecture. It will be clear. T1 architecture. It is also called tier 1 architecture. What happens in this? All these three things are on the same machine. Right? Suppose, this is your system. Right? You are the client. Right? And, you have made the server. And, DB is also here. All these three things are in the same PC. So, I call this tier 1 architecture. Right? This can be an example. Whenever you make a modern web application, you don't buy the server directly. What you do is, you make a local host. Local host means, a server is running in the computer. Right? So, when the server is running in the computer, you are using it. You are the client. And, you have created a server there. Which is created by local host. You have created that local host server. So, that server is not in any other remote location. It is not in any other system. It is in your computer. So, the client is also in your computer. Server is also in your computer. And, database is also in your computer. All these three things are in your computer. So, I call this tier 1 architecture. This is an example. When we will learn SQL, when we will learn SQL, when we will set up, you will see that you are the end user. And, the DBMS server which you will make, which you will make a schema, which you will enter, all that will be stored in your computer. And, the database, the DB, will also be stored in your computer. When all these three things are in one place, then I call it tier 1 architecture. Now, let's come to the second architecture. T2. Tier 2. What is tier 2? Let's understand it directly from the note. What is tier 2 architecture? In tier 2 architecture, the client machine invokes DB functionality through queries at the end of the server. That is, you are the user and this application is your PC. And, this is a remote PC. Remote PC is kept somewhere. It is basically a server. It is connected through the network. So, what is happening in this? Your application is connected to the server. So, what is happening in this? Your application is connected to the server. So, in this application, you are writing query statements. You are writing query statements. And, these query statements you are sending over the network. Ok? How are you sending the query statements through the network? Interface JDBC and ODBC. Through this, we are interacting between these two standards of client and server. So, what is the client? From here, he is sending your SQL query statements. So, this is you. Client. This is sending SQL query directly. Ok? Through JDBC. On the server. Where is the server? Somewhere there is a remote. Ok? Here, your DB is stored. So, that means DBMS is on the server. Ok? Your client machine is on the server. It communicates on the server. It wraps your SQL query and sends it. SQL query is understood by DBMS. It gives you the output. So, you will see that two PCs are involved here. Basically, your whole system is divided into two parts. That is, there is a client and a server. The communication is done through SQL query through which JDBC provides API standards. Third is the architecture. This is the third. This is the tier 2. This is the tier 3 architecture. Now, we will understand the application on a large scale. In that, you have to divide app into 3 logical components. Which are these three logical components? At first, this is the client machine. Then, you have the application server and the database system. Ok? What was happening in this? You are sending direct queries. Ok? In this, you are sending directly SQL queries. You will not directly send the SQL query. Your client machine is just a front-end, it doesn't give a direct DB call. There is no direct DB call happening here. Here, there was a direct DB call happening over the network. SQL query was being sent. Here, there will be no direct DB call. Here, your client machine, that is, the client's application will communicate with the app server. And when it will communicate with the app server, then app server will put a call on DB. And it will retrieve the data. After retrieving, it will return the app server. And then it will send the client by modifying the app server. That means, another step is added here. That is, the client machine communicates with the app server. Communicate with the app server. And the app server communicates with DB. That means, the client machine is not communicating directly with DB. Here, the client machine is communicating with the application server through an interface. And the application server is communicating with DB. So, here, this is the 3-tier architecture. That is, you have divided 3 into it. So, the big business logic, heavy business logic, like Amazon has been implemented, Facebook has been implemented, any social media has been implemented, in that case, we use the tier 3 architecture. So, this suits best in the WWW application. What is its biggest advantage? Its scalability increases due to distributed application servers. That is, there can be many client machines. Similarly, I can make many in server machines. So, if I have to serve billions of people in the world, then many applications, server machines, can be made. I will have to make many servers. It will not work with just one server. So, not just one server, multiple servers have been made. You have multiple clients. So, you have made many application servers. So, in this way, you can make distributed application servers. In this case, scalability will increase. Because you have divided things into 3 logical components. Data integrity will be maintained. How will data integrity be maintained? That is, the app server is working like a middle layer. Okay? So, it is possible that you are not so intelligent. Or you do not take care that you send a query in SQL which corrupts the database. Okay? Not all users are innocent like you. Some users may be a little mischievous. Mischievous as in they will send some vulnerability here. Vulnerability means they will send some bug or some vulnerability which will corrupt DB. If your user app sends such a query due to which your DB system will be corrupted. Then your entire tier 2 architecture will be failed. Basically, your entire database will be destroyed. So, in this case, data integrity is maintained. What will your app server do? It will filter out queries which can corrupt DB. Okay? Here, your queries will be filtered out which can corrupt DB. Okay? So, app server works like an interface. If someone is coming with such queries who is vulnerable. Who can harm DB. Then I will stop those queries on the application server layer. Okay? Security will be maintained. Data integrity is maintained. Security is also maintained. Because, we are not accessing directly to DB. We have stopped access to DB. We have installed an interface. We have installed a guard in between. Which will maintain the consistency of DB. It will maintain its security. It should not happen that your DB gets corrupted. Or you create wrong information or modifications in DB. So, tier 3 architecture is the best in this case. It is used in big applications. So, the example which I showed you. This one. This is the code of your application server. DB is the app on the server which is running. So, to contact DB, all these things are written by your JDBC. So, the example which I showed you. This is the app which we made. It was a world wide web application. So, in short, we have understood all this. What is tier 2 and tier 3 architecture? What is tier 1 architecture? This is application architecture. When you design an application, you think about what kind of application you want to make. Okay? The application which you are writing. The application which you are writing. How will it access the database? How will it access the network? Or like tier 1 architecture, you have made an app which you will use. Which is running on your computer. So, you will use tier 1 architecture. You will make such a system. You are making such a system which is used at home. Okay? Used at home. Means you have made such a server which your father, mother, all three, four, five devices will use at home. So, in local area network, you can implement tier 2 architecture like this. Because there will be no problem of security because people are using it at home. Tier 3 architecture is used in your www apps. Because I want application server here. Okay? So, I can improve scalability, keep data integrity, maintain security. Because you don't know what kind of user is sitting in which corner of the world. Okay? So, you need layers. You need things in layers. Okay? So, this was today's lecture in which we discussed many things. Most importantly, we defined your 3 scheme architecture. We discussed why this is important. That if someone is making their database management system, then he will have to provide abstraction of such levels. Okay? What was the end goal of abstraction? Our end goal was that we will support multiple users. Okay? So, we will discuss about the same data in personalized view. Okay? So, we understood what is instance, what is schema, what are data models. We will discuss data models in next class. What are languages in data? Okay? How do application programs access? We discussed about all these. I hope you understood these things. Things can be a little typical. Okay? But there is no problem. When we will discuss about data models in next video, we will discuss about logical schema, DB schema in more detail. Till then, good bye."}

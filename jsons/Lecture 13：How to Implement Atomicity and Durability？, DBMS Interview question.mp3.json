    "text": " Hello, how are you all? This is Lakshya. We are back with DBMX lecture no. 13. Today we are going to discuss a very important interview question. It is called How to implement Atomicity and Durability. Before discussing this, let's recap what is atomicity and durability. Atomicity is the atomic operation of a transaction. That means the transaction will either be completed or not. It will not be left in between. It is not like your money is deducted and then your money is lost or not returned. It is not possible. If it fails, it will be rolled back. We have read all this. What is durability? If your transaction is completed, you have told the system that the transaction has been completed, notified the user that it is completed, then whatever updates have been made in DB should persist. It should not happen that you have told the user that it is completed, but because of some failure in the DB, at the time of the transaction, when the transaction was being committed or after the transaction, there was a failure, then in that case, the changes in the DB should be persistent and durable. It should not happen that the changes are fizzled out and lost. It should not happen like this. This is durability. But how will we implement this thing? The most naive or easy way is shadow copy. Let's call it a shadow copy scheme. It is very simple. What we do in this is, you have an old DB copy on your disk. I call this before update. Any update before the operation. And there is a DB pointer. What is this DB pointer? This DB pointer is also on the disk. This is also on your disk. What is the work of this? What is the work of this DB pointer? At any instant of time, it will be pointing at the current DB. What is the copy of the current DB? What we do in this scheme is, we make a copy of the database. We make a copy and work on that copy. We make a copy in the RAM and work on that copy. After that, whenever the transaction is completed, then what we do is, we write the copy working on the RAM on the disk again. After writing, the DB pointer, which is an old pointer, we allocate it on new. Let's understand it once. What will you do? You will pick it up. You will make a copy of it on the RAM. And you made a copy on the RAM. Okay. Let's make a copy once. This video is sponsored by Cryo. Cryo is a world's leading work experience based learning platform.

I can say, All operations on new copy. Okay. Now after that, when the transaction is completed, After completion, What will OS do? This RAM copy will be written on disk again. Okay. So let's write on disk. New copy. On disk. Okay. Now, You have written it. But we will not bring the transaction in the committed state. We will not say that the transaction is committed. It is successful. We will not say that. We will say the transaction in the committed state only when When your DB pointer which is on disk. Which is on disk. It will start pointing on it. What will we do? We will remove this from here. And this pointer will be pointed on the new location. And when this new location will be pointed. That is, When DB pointer will be updated. I can say like this. That DB pointer. Updated. To new disk location. Then only I will notify. That the transaction is committed. That means your change is permanent. We can see this. When we write the new copy on disk. After writing, The old pointer of DB. Because it is getting disk meshed. We will point it on new location. That's why I can say that the transaction is committed. That is, your change is persisted. Isn't it? Very good. Let's go to notes. What is written about it? So what do we do in shadow copy scheme? Simply. Based on making on shadow copy. So we have made copies. Transition. As a transaction comes. What will that transaction do? Will make a copy of that database. On RAM. Okay. Keep this in mind. Will make a copy on RAM. Will write on disk later. Okay. What is this? One transaction will come at a time. Transition. Here the serial should come. Only then this scheme will work. Okay. Multiple transactions will not run concurrently. Will run serially. We have to serialize. So what are we doing? We are maintaining a DB pointer on disk. Okay. Which will point on current copy. Okay. Transition that wants to update. First create a complete copy. Complete copy is made here. Keep in mind. Complete copy. Okay. That's why it is inefficient. All further update. R2 will run on new copy. If at any point. Transition abort. The system deletes the new copy. And the older copy. That's why. The new copy. And the older copy. Is not affected. Now suppose. At the position. Where you made the new copy on RAM. And you were doing operations. When you were doing operations. At that time. DB pointer. Was located here only. Right. Now if at this point. Transition. Abort. Clicked. User came. User clicked on abort. Now when it will click on abort. So what will happen. You will delete the new copy. Will delete from RAM. Will call again. Right. And. Your old. Old. DB. Copy. That was first. You are located here. Right. My system. Or the user. Will know. That brother. Where is the old copy. Who will tell. That DB pointer will tell. So DB pointer. Was first located on old. So there will be no problem. If transition. Is aborted. So. He is pointing on it. So no problem. Transition has been aborted. Atmosphere. Is still maintained. Right. Let's move on. If transition. Success. If transition. Successful. So OS. All pages. That is. OS concept. All pages of the new copy of. DB is written on the disk. Let's write on the disk. DB system. Updates the DB pointer. To the new. Copy of DB. We talked about this. We will point it here. Right. New copy. Is now the current copy. New copy. Will become the current copy. We have understood. We will delete the old copy. Because. I said. Transition. Is successful. Right. The transaction. This point. Is very important. Listen carefully. The transaction. Is said to have committed. At point. Where the updated. DB is written. On the disk. You have copied here. You have copied here. After copying. The updated. Pointer. Suppose. Its pointer. On the disk. The pointer. 0x01. And its pointer. 0x02. Right. Let's suppose. First. It was pointing. At 0x01. Here. 0x01. Will be written. When you. Write here. That. Now. This is pointing. To 0x02. I will notify. The user. That. The transaction. Has been committed. Okay. We have to keep this thing. Now. Let's see. How is the atomicity. Maintained. If the transaction. Fails before. The DB pointer. Is updated. From 0x02. The transaction. Failed. Before. Here. So. What will we do. Simply. We will delete it. We will delete it. The DB pointer. Was already. Collocating. So. We have to delete. The new copy. We have to delete. The new copy. From RAM. Right. Hence. Either. All updates. Are reflected. Or none. So. We understood. Either. All updates. Will be reflected. Or. Not. So. This is. Atomicity. Now. Let's understand. How is the durability. Maintained. Here. I am repeating. This thing. Again. I will. Write 0x02. Then only. I will say. That the transaction. Is committed. Now. What is durability. Suppose. System. Failed. At any. Time. Before. The updated. Pointer. Is written. On the disk. Means. You have saved. The new copy. But. This. This. Point. Is. That. 0x02. Is not. Failed. So. You will. Read the. Db. Pointer. It will read the. Db. Pointer. Again. What will be written on it. 0. 01. Ok. Because. It. Was. Not. Written. At. This. Point. Failed. And. Will. See. The. Original. Copy. The. Point. Is. Not. Failed. So. If. The. Point. Is. Failed. Then. It. Will. Failed. And. Will. Not. Failed. And. Will. Failed. And. Will. Failed. And. Will. Failed. And. Will. Not. Failed. Here. If. It. Is. So. I Talked. I. During. One. S hj 1. Things. Are. OK. But. What. Is. Some. Mistake, Because. I. Have. Failed, Then. Everything, There. Will. Will. Failed, There. Failed. Will. Mustafa. Everything, Me. Me. I. Narrated, In. Which. Do. After. The.\u0438\u043d\u043e. Just, Before. All the pages of the new copy were written to the disk. Hence, when the system restart, it will read the new copy. Because all the copies were written before the system failed. And the DB pointer was also updated. So I will get a new copy. The old copy must have been deleted. So, this way I can maintain the atomicity and durability through the shadow copy scheme. Very good. Now listen carefully. When I am writing DB pointer from 0x01 to 0x02. What if something happens in the middle of this operation? What if it fails in the middle? So what will happen? This question must have come to your mind. No problem. The implementation is dependent on write to DB pointer being atomic. That is, write DB pointer. Change 0x01 to 0x02 DB pointer. This should be atomic. This should be atomic. All these implementations are based on this. So how do we do this? The disk system provides atomic updates to a block or a disk sector. It is an atomic update. Either it will be updated or not. So I am getting this hardware support. The hardware of the disk system writes like this. It works like this. That I can write the entire block or at least a disk sector atomically. So we make sure DB pointer lies entirely in single state. So we make sure DB pointer lies entirely in single state. So we keep the DB pointer in a single state. By storing DB pointer in the beginning of the block. We keep the block in a single state. Because in this state the disk system keeps its updates atomic. So 0x01 to 0x02 will either be in a single state or not. 0x02 will never fail in the middle. 0x02 will never fail in the middle. So this scheme is very good. It is very good for the theoretical aspect too. It is simple. It does not cause much problem in understanding. But with the help of the application, we can solve the problems of development. This is inefficient because every transaction will be copied. The transaction may have a very large DB. If your DB is in terabytes, then you will have to copy it every time. So this is an inefficient method. Let's discuss one more thing. DBMS has a recovery mechanism component. This recovery mechanism component is implemented in the DBMS. I hope you understood shadow copy. There will be no confusion in this. Now let's discuss a better method. We will have to make a copy in this. I call it log based recovery system. What is a log based recovery system? Whenever your transaction is being executed, You are maintaining some logs. You have written a log that you started the transaction. You have written a log that you changed this value in the transaction. You keep writing logs. You must be understanding what the benefit of writing logs is. But I store these logs in a stable storage. What is a stable storage? In a computer, in computer data technology, There is such storage that it is guaranteed. It guarantees the atomicity. Whether its operation is done or not. It guarantees the atomicity. Whatever its operation is, it will be atomic. And it will be stable storage. It will be robust. If there is a power failure or hardware failure in it, It will recover. Why am I using this? I said that your transaction is running. You are generating logs of the transaction. And if you keep them in the storage in which you have kept DB, What will be the problem with this? Now it is talking about what to do if DB fails. What will we do if DB fails? If DB fails, your logs will also disappear. So I maintain the logs in another place. And that is a stable storage. Stable storage is expensive. So I maintain that storage there. So this is a small overview. Let's understand it once. So let's come back to an example. Remember we gave an example. That you have an A account and B account. Initially, you have 1000 rupees in A account. And B account is 1000 rupees. So initially you have 2000 rupees. So your transaction T0 came. What was that transaction? You did read A and from A, 50 minus. Then you did write. In A. Then from B. 50 was added to B. And then you write B. So basically you have sent 50 rupees from A to B. This was it. So whenever this transaction is happening, So whenever this transaction is happening, So whenever this transaction is happening, I will maintain logs. I will maintain logs. So I will generate logs. So in logs, you said transaction has started. You said transaction is T0. You said transaction is T0. This is the identifier of transaction. It has written new value on A variable. This is new value. This is your variable. On which you are making changes. So you are generating logs. Let's understand it once. I have told you how logs are generated. Let's come to notes and understand. We want to say that The log is a sequence of records Which every transaction Which every transaction Which every transaction is maintained in your stable storage. And whenever there is a failure, I will be able to recover by reading these logs. We will understand it once through example. If any operation is performed on database, It will be recorded on the log. It will be written in the log. But the process of storing the log Should be done before The actual transaction happens. That means this log, You will write it first. Before doing this thing. Okay. This log you will write together. Before writing. You will write the log first. Then you will do the actual operation. Okay. It also makes sense. That you wrote the log later after the actual operation. Then I will not know what is happening. So first I will record what I want to do. Then I will perform it in the database. So that I know what I want to do. And then on the same basis, I will be able to recover things. Very good. So in this scheme, Its type comes first. Deferred Deferred DB modifications. Okay. Let's understand what will happen. Okay. Till now I have given so much idea That we write something in logs. Before doing the actual operation in any database, I write the log in stable storage. Okay. So you will understand the two types of this. Or the two implementation methodologies. You will be able to understand that. Don't worry. Let's move ahead. Now let's understand what we do in deferred DB modification. Okay. We understood that we are writing logs. So let's understand what we do in this. To ensure atomicity by recording all the DB modifications in the logs. We are recording in logs. But deferring the execution of all write operations until the final action of the transaction has been executed. That is, what is it saying? That in this example of your transaction, we are writing this log, this log, this log, and this log. So we will write these four logs. But till now, there is no modification in actual DB. We will do deferred modification. Deferred means to delay. We will do the modification late. What will we do? We will start the transaction first. After starting, you will write that the new value of T0A will be 950. Then you will write that in B, all these operations are there. Then you will write commit. When you will write commit at the end, when you have finally written commit, that is, you have said that the transaction has been completed. Now you will actually use these logs and do actual execution. You will do actual modification later. Okay. Before that, you were just writing log. When you saw that the commit state has come, after that you will actually go and start modifying in DB. That brother, you will do the balance in DB. So what will you do? For example, this was your DB. When you have written four logs, then this is A, this is B. Now what will you do? Now you will write new values. Now you are writing in DB. So you are writing late and deferred. Now what is the benefit of this? Let's understand this. If system crash before the transaction is complete or someone has aborted the transaction. Okay. Again understand that when you were doing this transaction, you were not doing actual modification in DB. You were simply writing logs. So when this work is happening, transaction is happening, you have written this, this, this, this. Right. Now suppose before commit, this happens, someone has aborted or the system has failed before commit, it is in atomicity. So before commit, before this position, transaction is aborted or failed. So what will you do? When you will come to the system, you will see that there is no commit. There is no commit. What does commit mean? There was no commit. So you will simply ignore these logs. You will ignore. Because there is atomicity, the transaction has failed. So I have to ignore all the logs written in the database. Now let's understand if the system crashed before the transaction completed or the user aborted. So the information written in the logs will be simply ignored. Nothing else. Now suppose the transaction has been completed. The record associated to it in the log file is executed. That means you have done this work, this work, the system has not failed or the user has not aborted. So you will simply write commit. Now what does commit mean? The transaction has been completed. Now after commit, you will start deferred writing. Now you will start writing 950 in it. We understood this. We have already understood that we do deferred updation in it. Now you will have a question in your mind that when we are doing deferred updation, that the transaction has been completed and we are doing deferred updation. The transaction has been completed. You have told the user that the transaction has been completed. Now how will the durability be maintained? After saying complete, you are writing 950, 250, now your system has failed. Now when you restart the system, you will see the logs. Logs are stable storage. In the logs, you will see that commit is written. That is, the transaction in T0 has been committed. That is, the corresponding records should be there or not. Now you will see the commit and you will commit the transaction in T0. That is, the durability is also maintained here. When I was trying to do durability, that is, when I was committing, if I failed while committing, and the transaction was completed, how did I know that? The commit is written in the logs. If the commit is written in the logs, then I will write it here. The durability is also maintained. We have written that if failure occurs while updating, that is, when the update is happening, that is, when I was updating, deferred updating, then the failure happened. So I will redo. Redo means I will go back to the logs and read it and perform all the work again. So here we will redo like this. So this is called deferred DB modification. Because in this, first we are writing logs, after writing logs, we are saying commit. After that we are going to write actual update in DB. Very good. This is your deferred modification. Second is your immediate. Immediate DB modification. What do we do in this? As the name says, I will update immediately. That is, the transaction is going on. As the transaction is going on, we will keep modifying in the active state in the DB. Let's understand this through the notes. DB modification to be output to the DB while the transaction is still in active state. That is, any write operation, what were we doing before? We were doing in deferred, write operation came, we did it. Later when the transaction is committed, then only I will start actual write in DB. Here what will happen? You will also log write operation. Just after logging, you will always keep in mind that you will log it first. Just after logging, you will pick it up and write it. That is, here the updation is going on again and again. So DB modification return by active transaction is also called uncommitted modification. That modification is uncommitted. Because it may happen that in the middle, if it fails, then I will have to rollback it. We will see how it happens. So once let's see the logs in this. What type of logs will be made? The logs you made in which 1, 2, 3, 3 fields were there. These were the logs of your deferred DB modification. Now let's see how the logs will be made in this in the immediate. So this type of logs will be made in this. Now look carefully, here one field has been added. One field is of old values. These are old values. These are new values. You must be understanding why we are using it. We are using it because you are doing immediate update here. You have written 950 instead of 1000 and all the transactions have failed. You will have to rollback for the atomicity. So for rollback, you should have information that what was the old value. So I will remove the old value from the old value. So this is old value. I will write it. Old item value. This is new item value. Now let's understand how we will maintain atomicity durability in this. In the event of crash or transaction fail crash or transaction fail anything can happen. System crash. System uses old value field of the record to restore modification of value. Now suppose your transaction failed at this position. So what you have to do is start the transaction. Because here is immediate modification. So you execute it. If there is immediate modification then write operation. Now you have done it in DB. So in DB you wrote 950 instead of 1000. Ok. Now what happened at this position your transaction failed. Fail or user called a word. Anything can happen. So you have to rollback for atomicity. So how will you rollback? You wrote 950. Now you will go to log. 950 is written. What is the old value of 950? So you will take the old value of 950 and you will write 1000 instead of 950. Ok. So in this way I will maintain atomicity. Let's move ahead. Update takes place only after log record instability. We know that first we write log and then we update. We have to keep this in mind. Because if you have done actual update first and then failed and you couldn't write in log then you won't be able to recover. Very good. Now let's see how failure handling is done. System failure before transaction complete or update. We have understood that if system failure before transaction complete or update. Suppose your system failed before this position. Or board call. So what do you do? Then old value field as used. You do undo operation. How to do undo operation? You write 950. You write new value here also. 950. Before this position transaction failed. So what will happen? You will take this old value and write 1000 again. And again write 2000. Sorry value should be 2050 here. You will understand. So basically I can see before commit. I will roll back. I have no problem. So you see carefully how important logs are. If transaction complete and system crashes. Suppose you said transaction completed. Then transaction has been completed. That means transaction has been completed. Now you have written in log that transaction has been completed. Now you are updating in DB. You are updating in DB. You are committing. Then your DB failed. Now DB failed. Now you cannot commit in DB. In this case you have to maintain durability. Because you have told user that commit. So what you will do? You will see whether this transaction was completed or not. Here it is written that transaction was completed. So you will redo the operation. By using these logs. You will do redo operation. You will perform the transaction again. You will change the corresponding values again. And I will replace the new field with the old field. So this is what we have written here. If transaction completed and system crashes. Then new value field is used to redo transaction. So you can see that. So you can see that. To redo transaction having commit logs in the log. To redo transaction having commit logs in the log. That means commit should be written in corresponding transaction. That means commit should be written in corresponding transaction. That means commit should be written in corresponding transaction. Then only I will redo it. If this line is not written. Then I will assume that transaction failed or got rewarded. Very good. So these are two mechanisms. Deferred DB modification and immediate DB modification. Which comes in log based recovery. Let's move ahead. One more log based. I call it checkpoint. Basically. This is the enhancement. In this you write logs. Suppose you have multiple transactions. Thousands of transactions. You will write logs. So your stable storage will be filled. Because in many real time use. It is not possible that you store so much old information. It is not possible that you store so much old information. Your cost will also increase. So what you do. In log based you use an improved method. Which I call checkpoint log based recovery method. Which I call checkpoint log based recovery method. Which I call checkpoint log based recovery method. Let's make checkpoints. In DB checkpoints are made. Before this all transactions. All transactions. All transactions. All transactions were on commit stage. I made XC2. All transactions before this were on commit stage. That means. When your DB state was consistent. At that point you make a checkpoint. After that if any transaction fails. Then you recover at that position. So I will not explain this much. You will do it simple. You will understand. Because you will understand. Because you have these basic methods. I will say these are the base methods. Which is building block. Log based recovery method. You will understand checkpoint easily. So this is your homework. This is your homework. That you will do checkpoint recovery method. You will do checkpoint recovery method. You will do checkpoint recovery method. And then you will write in comment section. That you understood. So this is your homework. I hope you understood this. So very good. Whenever I ask you questions in interview. First of all you will tell this method. This method. There can be many questions. If DB is 0x01. If DB is 0x02. If your system fails. Then what will you do? You will say that system cannot fail. Because I use such a storage. We wrote here. Because I use such storage. Which I am calling disk system. I use such a disk system. Because it performs atomic operation. On a particular block or sector. So it will be atomic. So this 0x01 or DB pointer's updation will be atomic. So this type of cross questioning can be done. All the things have been told to you. Log based recovery method is very important. Which is better than shadow based copy method. We will further improve this from checkpoint. Very good. So in this video that's it. Goodbye."

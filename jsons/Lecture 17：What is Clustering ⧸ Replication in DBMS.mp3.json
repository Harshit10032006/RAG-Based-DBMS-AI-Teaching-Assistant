    "text": " Hello, this is Lakshya and today we are going to discuss a very important topic on DBMS lecture 17. A topic which is used a lot on the internet, servers and database systems. The concept is called Clustering. What is clustering? The second name of this is Replica Set. I hope you are understanding this. Let me give you an example. Suppose you have a database with all the information of Amazon. Now tell me one thing. There are millions of customers and millions of requests. There are customers from all over the world and there is only one database. If there is only one database and there are many requests, then it is necessary to handle millions of requests. Seqnually or synchronously. But the problem is that if you have a system of one database in a computer, no matter how much you have scaled it vertically, no matter how much you have made it a powerful supercomputer, but if there are so many requests worldwide in www, it is very difficult to serve. This video is sponsored by Cryo. Cryo is a world's leading work experience based learning platform. Where you can enhance your software skills and also grab top-debt jobs. Unlike usual courses, you are going to learn full-stack development or backend development in Cryo. But by building industry-level projects in a real developer. At the end of their programs, you will have made a lot of projects, which will make your resume more effective and will also become a strong GitHub profile. You are in full-stack development, backend development, what tech are you going to use, all of that is also visible here. And you are also going to get personalized career assistance. So that your dream job is double surety. What do you have to do? I attach a link in the description. By using it, you can take the maximum possible discount on Cryo programs. And you can also unlock some free resources. So quickly go to the description. Use the link. Grab a placement. And give me a party. So book your free trial now. Second, if suppose this database gets downed. For some reason, this computer gets downed. Then your availability will be lost. Your website will get downed. You won't be able to see anything. Your users will shout at you. Right? You will face a problem. So to solve this thing, in DBMS, there is a concept which mostly arose when internet became very popular. Now, we have read that NoSQL databases are used there where there is internet. You have to make multiple servers. You have to do horizontal scaling. You have to launch your website on the internet. In the server of the website, you mostly use NoSQL. Right? This is the work of NoSQL. So this is used more there. In NoSQL. Okay? It is also used in SQL. We can do it. But mostly it is used there. So MongoDB is also used for this. It is a very good example. It is a replica set. It is a function by doing replication. Or it provides a concept by doing replication. You can make replicas of the database in this. Okay? A lot of mess has been made. Let's understand once what exactly is this thing. What you do is, make one server as S1. Make one server as S2. Make another server as S3. Okay? Now these will be your servers. Now these set of servers. Set of servers. Or I can say replica sets. Why am I saying replica sets? You have understood. That you have only one database. The database is only one. And its replica is database 1, D2 and D3. And D1 is equal to D2 is equal to D3. That means the same data is stored in all three servers. Suppose here the data of the users of Amazon was stored. Okay? Then the data of users is same. User's data is here also, time for data of users is here also. It is not like, in S1 more users data is there, in S2 less user data is there. In all three, the data of the same users is there. Replicas are made. Okay? Same is, S1 equal to S2. The data set, which is the data information, which is stored in it, is the same. Okay? Suppose there is thousands user information in this, then in this also there is the same information of the same thousands users. In S2 as well, there is the same information of the same thousand expressions. Oh! Now this set of replicas or servers is called cluster This is one cluster This is cluster Cluster means bundle, collection, group So this is clustering When you manage your system like this You make same instance, make replicas and store them in a cluster Why are we doing this? We are making replicas Why are we doing replicas? Why are we doing replicas? I told you that all three are same Why are we doing this? The best example of this is redundancy Now you will say that in database management system You must have heard about redundancy Redundancy should not happen Redundancy is not a useless thing It is not like that Everytime redundancy is not useless Here we are not talking about the redundancy Because of which anomalies were generated Here we are not storing same student Rahul Here this is not happening Here same user's information is there in this server All the users' information is there All the users' information in this server All users' information in this server Repeated information is in different servers If Rahul's information is here Then Rahul's information will be there too And Rahul's information will be here too So within same database it is not replicated. This is another type of redundancy that the data in one server is replicated in other servers. So what is the benefit of this redundancy? Now we have come to know that the same data sets are sitting in all the servers. Now suppose S1 is shut down for some reason. Now what are the reasons for shut down? It is possible that a hacker has attacked S1 and you have interrupted it. I think there is some illegal activity going on in this. So you will want to shut down S1 by running away. This is a real-time scenario. Second, you are doing maintenance. Your regular maintenance is going on or any ad sector, any information or any platform So you have a problem with your S1 node and you have to shut it down. Now there may be some confusion. What is S1 server? What is the node? What is the host? Simply put it like this that there is a computer which is a very good capable computer. It is connected to the internet. Its main job is to store the data and it receives requests on it. And it processes the data and sends it back. Ok. It is a computer. Server is a computer. Ok. Now The main advantage of this is that the website will always be on. It will not be blocked. Your website will always be available. Users will always be able to access it. So the main advantage of this is that due to introducing redundancy, you made your system highly available. Ok. What is the other advantage of this? Now look carefully. We must have read abstractions. Now here a layer of abstraction has been added. Clustering adds a layer of abstraction. How is that? The user does not know whether data is coming from S1 or S2 or S3. He is getting data. Ok. He is getting data. And you have abstracted this thing. Ok. You are not showing the user. You have hidden it. That information is coming from S1, S2 or S3. That information is coming from somewhere. Ok. What is the second advantage of this? Load balancing. Now what is load balancing? Now we were talking in the beginning that we get multiple requests. Multiple requests. Ok. Millions of requests can come. Millions of requests. Right. Now suppose if there is only one server. If there is only one server. Suppose if there is a million of requests coming. Then all the server has to be handled sequentially. Ok. So this server basically gets loaded. And it can be hanged or crashed. Ok. So better than this, if I have replicasets. I have many replicas made of the same DB. Of the same dataset. So I have to load balance them. Ok. So can I load balance them? Some requests I will give to S1. Some requests I will give to S2. Some requests I will give to S3. Ok. So there were so many requests. I will send something here. I will send something here. I will send something here. Ok. So what will happen with this? Load will be balanced. No system will crash. Ok. Because if a lot of information is put in one system. A lot of load will be put in it. So there are many chances that it will crash. Ok. So this is my advantage. That I am running by doing load balancing. So my system. My system does not crash. It keeps running robustly. And the website never gets down. Database never gets affected. Ok. Now if you want to do load balancing. Then you have to put a logic. A layer of abstraction. Here you have to put an abstraction. You have to put an interface. And what will that layer do? What will that layer do? That will be the layer. The layer of load balancer. The layer of load balancer. You must have understood. Ok. A lot of your requests are coming. And what will you do? You will see. Which server is there? Which server is less loaded? Is S1 less loaded? Or is S2 less loaded? Whatever is less loaded. I will give the request to that. I will pass on the request. Pass on the new request. Ok. So basically what do we want? If we have made a replica set. Then we need a load balancer. In our architecture, what will that load balancer do? That whatever server's replica. Whatever server is the least loaded. That request should be given to that new request. Ok. So we will understand that load balancing is a very big. Benefit. That I will benefit from load balancing. Now look carefully that all the things are going somewhere. Going towards availability. Why are we doing load balancing? We are doing load balancing so that first it becomes fast. If only one server is loaded then it will be delayed. So that your request will be executed fast. Second, if only one server is loaded then it will crash. Everything is going towards availability. Your website should be on every time. It should not happen that your website is down. Ok. So third and the most important. Its advantage is availability. When I will call it high availability. What does high availability mean? If your S1 is down. Ok. Let's write it properly once. If your S1 is down. Then S2 and S3 is available as a backup. So you are able to ensure at any point of time. That your request will be executed by any server. And the user will not even know that the request has come from S2. Because there is a layer of abstraction. Ok. Whatever server is available, the request will come from that. And because all the servers have the same information store. So the user will always get the same data. Ok. Very good. So these were three very important examples of clustering. And clustering is very important. And in today's date, whatever you are using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube. Whatever you are using, clustering is applied in all. Replica sets are made. Ok. And the replica set that is made. I will tell you a very good example of that. And which is also your homework. You will read it properly. You have to read content delivery network. Purely replica set and clustering is related. Ok. What will you read about this? You will read from the internet. Ok. You will read from the internet. And you will tell the comment section. I will give you a little hint. What is this? You make a group of servers and distribute them geographically. After distributing geographically, the same data is also in India. The same data is also in the US. The same data is also in Europe. Now whenever the nearest to it. Like whenever people of India will send a request. So that thing will be sent to the Indian server. And so that you get the response of your request after the fast process. So in this way, to do fast delivery of content. I divide the group of servers geographically. So that they work together. And those replica sets are YouTube's database. Which is in India's data server. That will be in the US data server. Ok. Very good. I am not going into much detail about this. It is your homework. You will read it properly. Ok. And once tell in the comment section. Whether you understand or not. This is a very important concept. You should know this. We have covered it in a very quick video. Let's go to the notes quickly. Let's go to the notes and see what is written about it. So clustering. Which is also called making replica sets. What is the replica set? Group of servers. So that they work together. Process of combining more than one server. And instance connecting a single database. What am I saying about single database? That there is only single data in it. There is only one data. There is only one data. There is only one data set. It is repeated. On different servers. Ok. We have seen the advantages of this. Advantage of data redundancy. There is load balancing. There is high availability. Ok. And another advantage of load balancing is that you can do scaling. This can provide scaling seamlessly. Scaling means when many user requests keep increasing. So one server is not able to load it. So you have made the servers replica. Ok. So with the help of load balancing. Basically, you can handle the new requests. The more requests are coming. Ok. And this ensures high availability. Because if you have high availability. If one server is loaded. Then it can crash. High availability. The work of all these is to ensure high availability. Your website should keep running. Ok. How does clustering work? How does clustering work? We do clustering work. In a clustering architecture, all the requests are split in many computers. So that individual user request is executed. Ok. The same simple. Many requests are coming. While looking at them, load balancer sees which computer or which node, which server is less loaded. I send it on that. So many requests are coming. Many requests are coming. Whatever server is less loaded. Let's send it on that. Ok. So this is how clustering architecture works. So I hope you understand. Clustering must have become clear in your mind. It is a very important topic. In real time. All companies. Big big product based companies. In their product. Whatever their internet based product is. They definitely use clustering. To ensure high availability. That their users. Exceed. In real time. So in real time. Clustering is very important. So in real time. Clustering is very important. In real time. Clustering is very important. So in real time. Clustering is very important. So in real time. Clustering is very important. So in real time. Clustering is very important. So in real time. Clustering is very important. Clustering is very important. Ok. So I hope that. You have got a seamless experience. That you never down their website. Ok. Very good. See you in next lecture. Till then. Good bye."
